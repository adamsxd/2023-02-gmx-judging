# Unreliability of timestamps could lead to unfair manipulation of actions

## Summary
The system relies on getting prices at the timestamp in the block in which the specific order/deposit is created. Therefore the timestamp is extremely important as it dictates the price of entry/exit. The arbitrum docs state that relying on time stamps in the short term is unreliable!

## Vulnerability Detail
The arbitrum docs state:
"As a general rule, any timing assumptions a contract makes about block numbers and timestamps should be considered generally reliable in the longer term (i.e., on the order of at least several hours) but **unreliable in the shorter term (minutes).**"
https://developer.arbitrum.io/time

The GMX contracts incorrectly assume the short term relaiblity of arbitrum block timestamps and use this to price the system and actions. 


## Impact
Since timestamps cannot be relied on in the short term, this can cause various catastrphoic issues, as the prices used to price entries/exits and orders could be manipulated in order to show large gains. 

Given this is a short term trading platform, and massive trades and executions happen in the order of minutes, this short term unreliability can have massive consequences. Favourable entries and exits can allow users to profit to the detriment of LPs and various other users.


## Code Snippet
This is evidenced setPrices in Oracle.sol which sets prices for all of the actions in the system using the price signed and delivered by the keeper.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possibility could be requiring a certain hold time of positions to reach the point of reliability - timestamps should be considered generally reliable in the longer term (i.e., on the order of at least several hours).
