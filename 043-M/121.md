# Oracle assumes stable coin never depegs

## Summary
stable token oracle assumes the token does not depeg
## Vulnerability Detail
For some reference a stable token or coin is a token that is designed to not deviate from a set price, most stable tokens are pegged to the value 1 USD.

The protocol gets the stable price of a token from an oracle. From the code below we can see that the logic assumes that the token remains stable and does not depeg.
```solidity
   // @dev get the stable price of a token
    // @param dataStore DataStore
    // @param token the token to get the price for
    // @return the stable price of the token
    function getStablePrice(DataStore dataStore, address token) public view returns (uint256) {
        return dataStore.getUint(Keys.stablePriceKey(token));
    }
```
the use of this code is present in the oracle as shown below.
```solidity
    uint256 stablePrice = getStablePrice(dataStore, token);

            Price.Props memory priceProps;

            if (stablePrice > 0) {
                priceProps = Price.Props(
                    price < stablePrice ? price : stablePrice,
                    price < stablePrice ? stablePrice : price
                );
            } else {
                priceProps = Price.Props(
                    price,
                    price
                );
            }

            primaryPrices[token] = priceProps;

            tokensWithPrices.add(token);
```

The problem arises because the protocol assumes that the price of a stable coin will not depeg. This is not a good assumption as we have seen so many stable coins depeg in the past months. Some of these coins are luna UST, USDT, and USDC. 

In the docs it is stated that the protocol handles depegging of coins, you can read that in the link below.

Although the protocol promises that depegging will not be an issue, i do not see any implementation of logic described in the docs above.
## Impact
Since the protocol assumes that a stable coin is always pegged, in a scenario where a stable coin like usdc depegs the protocol and user will suffer a severe loss of funds, especially in cases like UST.

Any user who execute a trade will have their trade settled at the wrong price because of this assumption leading to loss of their funds.

Additionally the protocol could suffer loss of funds if it is valuing a stable coin at 1 USD while the actual price may be way lower.

## Recommendation
Add logic that handles the depegging of a stable coin.
