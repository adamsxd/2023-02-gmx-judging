# keepers might have to pay more fees and not get reimbursed

## Summary

User A makes 5 deposits each with a max amount of swap path and for each one, the keeper will pay more and more gas than the user because when the keeper executes those txs the `tx.gasPrice` will be more than the user paid.
//because it depends on market conditions and the user can make the keeper pay a lot

## Vulnerability Detail

If the user has a huge gas limit but since tx.gasPrice is low and the chain is in low depend and then when the keeper makes the tx the chain is in high depend this can be caused naturally or by the attacker but since tx.gasPrice is higher the keeper will not be reimbursed for the extra gas and will lose funds

## Impact
Since this check below happens the keeper will only get what the user paid nothing more and since the current gas price is higher the keeper has no way of getting more funds it will cost too much and keepers won't make the tx and since the keeper won't do it the deposit won't get executed and the with the right market conditions the user can get more market tokens when the `tx.gasPrice` goes down the user gains free tokens.
## Code Snippet
The keeper wont get more fees just what user which can cause issues
```solidity
        if (executionFeeForKeeper > executionFee) {
            executionFeeForKeeper = executionFee;
        }
```
```solidity
        uint256 gasUsed = startingGas - gasleft();
        uint256 executionFeeForKeeper = adjustGasUsage(dataStore, gasUsed) * tx.gasprice;


```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

make the tx revert if gas is high usage or have a system to deal with high chain gas usage(have a way to keepers to deal with gas issues)
