# when execute deposit fails, cancel deposit will be called which means that execution fee for keeper will be little for executing the cancellation depending on where the executeDeposit fails

## Summary
When execute deposit fails, the deposit will be automatically cancelled. However, since executeDeposit has taken up a portion of the execution fee,  execution fee left for cancellation might be little and keeper will lose out on execution fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `executeDeposit` when an error is thrown, `_handleDepositError` is called.
```solidity
            _handleDepositError(
                key,
                startingGas,
                reasonBytes
            );
```
Notice that in `_handleDepositError` that `cancelDeposit` is called which will pay execution fee to the keeper. However, since the failure can have failed at the late stage of executeDeposit, the execution fee left for the cancellation will be little for the keeper. 
```solidity
    function _handleDepositError(
        bytes32 key,
        uint256 startingGas,
        bytes memory reasonBytes
    ) internal {
        (string memory reason, /* bool hasRevertMessage */) = ErrorUtils.getRevertMessage(reasonBytes);


        bytes4 errorSelector = ErrorUtils.getErrorSelectorFromData(reasonBytes);


        if (OracleUtils.isEmptyPriceError(errorSelector)) {
            ErrorUtils.revertWithCustomError(reasonBytes);
        }


        DepositUtils.cancelDeposit(
            dataStore,
            eventEmitter,
            depositVault,
            key,
            msg.sender,
            startingGas,
            reason,
            reasonBytes
        );
    }
}
```

Note: This also applies to failed `executeWithdrawal`.

## Impact
Keeper will lose out on execution fee in the event of a failed deposit.

## Recommendation
Recommend increasing the minimum required execution fee to account for failed deposit and refund the excess to the user when a deposit succeeds.
