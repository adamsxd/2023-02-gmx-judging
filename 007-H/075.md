# The ````callbacks```` are exposed to ````returnbomb```` attack

## Summary
````callbacks```` such as ````afterDepositExecution()````, ````afterDepositCancellation()```` and ````afterOrderExecution()```` are not implemented properly. The ````revert```` reason size is not checked, they are all exposed to ````returnbomb```` attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
Take ````afterOrderExecution()```` for example, the ````order.callbackGasLimit()```` is freely set by users, attackers can set it large enough to make ````afterOrderExecution()```` optionally revert after call on L117.
Let's say the transaction's normal gas cost for remaining process after L118 is 50,000.  Attackers can set ````order.callbackGasLimit()```` to 100,000, and revert with long ````reasonBytes```` which costs 90,000 gas on memory usage. It will trigger out of gas revert on L118, as a standard solidity call will copy any amount of bytes from return of subcall to local memory.
```solidity
File: gmx-synthetics\contracts\callback\CallbackUtils.sol
114:     function afterOrderExecution(bytes32 key, Order.Props memory order) internal {
115:         if (!isValidCallbackContract(order.callbackContract())) { return; }
116: 
117:         try IOrderCallbackReceiver(order.callbackContract()).afterOrderExecution{ gas: order.callbackGasLimit() }(key, order) {
118:         } catch (bytes memory reasonBytes) {
119:             (string memory reason, /* bool hasRevertMessage */) = ErrorUtils.getRevertMessage(reasonBytes);
120:             emit AfterOrderExecutionError(key, order, reason, reasonBytes);
121:         }
122:     }
```

## Impact
The issue will introduce many attack vectors such as risk free trade.
Let's say it's the ETH/USDC market, the confirmation time is 5 minutes and the current ETH price is $1000.
The attacker opens a long position, 5 minutes later, the price goes down to $950, the order keeper tries to execute the order.
Now the attacker can stop order execution to avoid loss. On the other hand, if price goes up, the attacker can submit a position close request by back running the order keeper's transaction to lock profit.

## Recommendation
Limit the the length of ````reasonBytes````
