# Loading arbitrary's contract data to memory allows grieffing attack

## Summary
Incorrect handling of returned data will cost more gas to keepers if callback contracts return an extense amount of data for the keeper to handle in the catch statement.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/callback/CallbackUtils.sol#L79

## Vulnerability Detail
In the functions from the callbackUtils.sol file, when execution fails, those functions load the memory data returned by the callbackContract(), which user can input to their own malicious contract returning extense data inside the gasLimit to increase the cost of processing that data for the keeper.

    function afterDepositExecution(bytes32 key, Deposit.Props memory deposit) internal {
        if (!isValidCallbackContract(deposit.callbackContract())) { return; }

        try IDepositCallbackReceiver(deposit.callbackContract()).afterDepositExecution{ gas: deposit.callbackGasLimit() }(key, deposit) {
        } catch (bytes memory reasonBytes) {
            (string memory reason, /* bool hasRevertMessage */) = ErrorUtils.getRevertMessage(reasonBytes);
            emit AfterDepositExecutionError(key, deposit, reason, reasonBytes);
        }
    }

Therefore the attack is not profitable for the attacker but rather costs gas to the keeper. Because instead of reverting on failure, they are handling the error from the callbackContract() in the catch statement, loading the memory data, which costs gas.

## Impact
Increase the gas cost for the keeper in failed transactions by loading extra data to memory that callbackUtils handles.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is not a good practice to load data from arbitrary contracts because it opens the attack vector for grieffing attacks. Consider  not loading that data and reverting on failure
