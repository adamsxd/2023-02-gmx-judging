# Timelock constructor doesn't check that `timelockDelay <= MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY`

## Summary
Timelock constructor doesn't check that `timelockDelay <= MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY`
## Vulnerability Detail
Timelock contract has `timelockDelay` variable that [should not be bigger](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/config/Timelock.sol#L61-L63) than `MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY` param.

But [constructor doesn't check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/config/Timelock.sol#L44) that provided variable is not bigger than `MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY` param.

Because of that Timelock can be initialized with `timelockDelay` that is bigger than MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY.
## Impact
Timelock can be initialized with `timelockDelay` that is bigger than MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY

## Recommendation
Check in constructor that `timelockDelay` is not bigger than MAX_TIMELOCK_DELAY
