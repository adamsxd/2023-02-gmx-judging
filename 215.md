# if the token gas limit is too little it can be an issue

## Summary

if the token gas limit is too little and the function reverts but on the createDeposit, it didn't need to or the Transfer for depositing is less than here it, users funds will be lost

## Vulnerability Detail

If the system only allows a small  gas limit on the call back/on native transfer/transfer  and it reverts or can't go out to an external protocol users funds will be lost

## Impact

protocols can integrate  with the gmx and some users' funds can be stuck

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        MarketToken(payable(order.market())).transferOut(
            result.outputToken,
            order.receiver(),
            result.outputAmount,
            order.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()
```
