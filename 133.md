# Single-sided deposits that are auto-adjusted account for tokens that were never transferred

## Summary

Deposits of only the long collateral token, when doing so results in an auto-adjustment of the order to minimize price impact, results in account for tokens that were never transferred


## Vulnerability Detail

When such a deposit is made, only the long collateral token is deposited, but after the adjustment is made, fees and pool deltas operate on the adjusted amounts, and account for short collateral tokens that were never actually deposited.


## Impact

Short collateral token fees for the fee receiver will be unavailable in the stated amount, and the pool's value, which is used to determine the value of deposits, withdrawals, and reserves, will be miscalculated. Pools can eventually become insolvent, and users won't be able to withdraw their capital or profits.


## Code Snippet

After the long collateral token is deposited via the [`swap()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L129-L136) function, the long token amount is over-written, as is the zero short token amount:

```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol : ExecuteDepositUtils.executeDeposit()   #1

157            // for the first case, the deposited token will be recorded in initialLongTokenAmount, it is not possible
158            // to have an initialShortTokenAmount because recordTransferIn records a single difference in balance of the token
159            // after all transfers
160            // for both cases, split the longTokenAmount into longTokenAmount and shortTokenAmount to minimize
161            // price impact for the user
162            if (market.longToken == market.shortToken) {
163                if (cache.shortTokenAmount > 0) {
164                    revert UnexpectedNonZeroShortAmount();
165                }
166    
167 @>             (cache.longTokenAmount, cache.shortTokenAmount) = getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts(
168                    params.dataStore,
169                    market,
170                    cache.longTokenAmount
171                );
172            }
173    
174            cache.longTokenUsd = cache.longTokenAmount * prices.longTokenPrice.midPrice();
175            cache.shortTokenUsd = cache.shortTokenAmount * prices.shortTokenPrice.midPrice();
176    
177:           cache.receivedMarketTokens;
```

And inside each call to `_executeDeposit()` for the long and short token amounts, the fee tracking is [incremented](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L260) as is the amount ["deposited"](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L356).


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Perform an actual swap of amount of amount needed to properly balance the pool, but only if doing so is cheaper than the price impact of doing no adjustment at all.
