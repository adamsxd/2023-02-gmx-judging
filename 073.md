# `MarketUtils.claimFundingFees()` Does Not Verify Validity Of The Market

## Summary

Claiming funding fees does not validate the market being claimed. It is possible to trigger `MarketToken(market).transferOut()` on a `market` which is a `StrictBank` such as a deposit vault or withdrawal vault.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no validation that the tuple `(market, token, account)` is valid in `claimFundingFees()`. An invalid tuple will generate a key and `getUint()` from the store with this key. The return value will be `claimableAmount = 0` since this value was not inserted.

Although the `claimableAmount` is zero there is still a negative impact on the protocol. The attack occurs when we call a `StrictBank` such as `WithdrawalVault` or `DepositVault`.

If one of these vaults have a balance that has not been recorded yet, it will be permanently locked in the `StrictBank`. That is because `_afterTransferOut()` in `StrictBank` will set `tokenBalances[token]` to the current balance. The balance is not accounted for anywhere else in the protocol and so is therefore stuck in the bank. 

## Impact

The impact is that an attacker may permanently lock funds in a `StrictBank` by causing an error in the accounting.

The issue is rated as medium, although it may cause permanent loss of funds there must already be funds within the `StrictBank` to allow this attack to occur.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The recommendation is to first call `validateEnabledMarket()` to ensure it is a valid `market` token that is being called. 

Additionally consider not calling `MarketToken.transferOut()` if the `claimableAmount` is zero.
