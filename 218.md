# no checking round data stale and decimals

## Summary

no checking round data stale and decimals

## Vulnerability Detail

If chainlink goes down and there is stale pricing of tokens the protocol can be hacked and loss funds

## Impact

can cause loss of funds like if chainlike prices get stale and the decrease of the price of eth is not recorded the protocol will be rewarding eth long users profit when they are not getting profit.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
            (
                ,
                /* uint80 roundID */
                int256 _price,
                ,
                ,

            ) = /* uint256 startedAt */
                /* uint256 timestamp */
                /* uint80 answeredInRound */
                priceFeed.latestRoundData();

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```solidity
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Chainlink:: Stale price")
