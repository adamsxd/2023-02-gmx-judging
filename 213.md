# Malicious or hacked admin can steal tokens

## Summary

In `Bank.sol` we have [transferOut()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/bank/Bank.sol#L88-L100) This function is external and can be call only by `onlyController`. It is possible malicious or hacked owner to steal tokens.

```solidity
function transferOut( 
        address token,
        address receiver,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyController {
        _transferOut(token, receiver, amount);
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
As can be seen from the code snippet , nothing can stop malicious or hacked admin to steal tokens.  He can use `address receiver` and send tokens for yourself. 

## Impact
