# An attacker can avoid being auto Delevareged by using the  keepers input to its disadvantage

## Summary

An attacker can avoid being auto Delevareged by using the keepers' input to its disadvantage

## Vulnerability Detail

When the long token dosnt equal the index token the system can become insolvent, to solve this we auto-deleverage positions.
But an attacker can get around adl, by updating the position by x `(x=sizeInusd)` and since this check below would revert the keeper won't execute it and the positions wont get delevareged which can make the protocol unsolvent

```solidity
   if (params.sizeDeltaUsd > position.sizeInUsd()) {
            revert InvalidSizeDeltaForAdl(params.sizeDeltaUsd, position.sizeInUsd());
        }

```

ex:
bob has $10,000 of  collateral and has 10x leverage on his position = $100,000
Now, let's say the price of an index token suddenly drops by 50%, below Bob's liquidation price. At this point, Bob's position is highly leveraged, and he has lost $50,000, which is five times his initial collateral. Then the exchange might have to take the bad debt.
2. the keeper makes a tx  to add the position and decrease the leverage
3. bob front runs the keeper and makes the `position.sizeInUsd`-1
the keeper function would revert which is an issue in itself but the effects of a revert mean if there is a huge decrease in price(rapid rate ) the protocol won't be able to recover and the attacker(bob) will cause bad debt

## Impact

bad debt to the protocol

## Code Snippet

```solidity
   if (params.sizeDeltaUsd > position.sizeInUsd()) {
            revert InvalidSizeDeltaForAdl(params.sizeDeltaUsd, position.sizeInUsd());
        }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

remove that check or make keepers use flash bots
