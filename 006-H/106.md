# A component in fees is incorrectly double-charged and hence one additional portion remains in the market pool

## Summary

`borrowingFeeAmountForFeeReceiver` is double-counted in `totalNetCostAmount` and the additional amount remains in the market pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

Fee calculation is initiated in `IncreasePositionUtils.processCollateral`. 
`PositionPricingUtils.getPositionFees` is called. 
The important variable in the output is `totalNetCostAmount`, which is subtracted from the output tokens of the swap chain to get `collateralDeltaAmount` which is used to increase position collateral amount and total collateral amount.

Problem is that the leftover values in `totalNetCostAmount` do not match up with the values in `feeAmountForPool` which is to be left in the pool - there is the an `borrowingFeeAmountForFeeReceiver`.

`feeAmountForPool` is defined as:
```solidity
fees.feeAmountForPool = fees.positionFeeAmountForPool + fees.borrowingFeeAmount - borrowingFeeAmountForFeeReceiver;
```
which can be rearranged as:
```solidity
fees.feeAmountForPool + borrowingFeeAmountForFeeReceiver = fees.positionFeeAmountForPool + fees.borrowingFeeAmount;
```

`totalNetCostAmount` is defined as:
```solidity
fees.totalNetCostAmount = fees.referral.affiliateRewardAmount + fees.feeReceiverAmount + fees.positionFeeAmountForPool + fees.funding.fundingFeeAmount + fees.borrowingFeeAmount;
```
substituting `fees.positionFeeAmountForPool + fees.funding.fundingFeeAmount`
```solidity
fees.totalNetCostAmount = fees.referral.affiliateRewardAmount + fees.feeReceiverAmount + fees.funding.fundingFeeAmount + fees.feeAmountForPool + borrowingFeeAmountForFeeReceiver;
```

However `fees.feeReceiverAmount` is defined as follows:
```solidity
fees.feeReceiverAmount = previous.fees.feeReceiverAmount + borrowingFeeAmountForFeeReceiver;
```

subbing this into `totalNetCostAmount`, the result is:
```solidity
fees.totalNetCostAmount = fees.referral.affiliateRewardAmount + previous.fees.feeReceiverAmount + fees.funding.fundingFeeAmount + fees.feeAmountForPool + 2*borrowingFeeAmountForFeeReceiver;
```

## Impact

User collateral position is always charged 2 times the `borrowingFeeAmountForFeeReceiver`, 1 of which is claimed by the receiver via incrementing `feeReceiverAmount` and another 1 which remains in the market pool.

This initial loss of user funds would lead to disruption in internal accounting of the system.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change `totalNetCostAmount` equation to:

```solidity
 totalNetCostAmount = F.referral.affiliateRewardAmount + F.feeReceiverAmount + F.funding.fundingFeeAmount + F.feeAmountForPool
```

where F is output of `getPositionFees`
