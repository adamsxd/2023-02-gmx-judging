# Order creation does not ensure the market is enabled

## Summary

Order creation does not ensure the market of the order is enabled

## Vulnerability Detail

During order creation, if there's a swap path, it's checked for whether the markets in the path are enabled, but if not (the normal case) the market is not checked


## Impact

A user will submit an order which, if it's a limit order, will be frozen, and the gas execution fee will be taken. The user would then have to cancel the order, spending even more gas.


## Code Snippet

Swap path is checked if it exists, but the market itself is not checked, as is done for the other operations:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/OrderUtils.sol : OrderUtils.createOrder()   #1

104            // validate swap path markets
105 @>         MarketUtils.getEnabledMarkets(
106                dataStore,
107                params.addresses.swapPath
108            );
109    
110            Order.Props memory order;
111    
112            order.setAccount(account);
113            order.setReceiver(params.addresses.receiver);
114            order.setCallbackContract(params.addresses.callbackContract);
115:           order.setMarket(params.addresses.market);
```

It's only checked during [execution](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/BaseOrderHandler.sol#L96), and will cause the order to be [frozen](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol#L267)
