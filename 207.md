# User can game the order system

## Summary
user can game order system by setting out of range trigger price
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol is aware of this attack vector and it is evident when we read the comments of the code snippet below.
```solidity
  // freeze unfulfillable orders to prevent the order system from being gamed
            // an example of gaming would be if a user creates a limit order
            // with size greater than the available amount in the pool
            // the user waits for their limit price to be hit, and if price
            // moves in their favour after, they can deposit into the pool
            // to allow the order to be executed then close the order for a profit
            //
            // frozen order keepers will have additional validations before executing
            // frozen orders to prevent gaming
            //
            // alternatively, the user can call updateOrder to unfreeze the order
            OrderUtils.freezeOrder(
                dataStore,
                eventEmitter,
                orderVault,
                key,
                msg.sender,
                startingGas,
                reason,
                reasonBytes
            );
```
Although the protocol is aware of this attack, it is still possible in the `upadateOrder` function.
```solidity
 function updateOrder(
        bytes32 key,
        uint256 sizeDeltaUsd,
        uint256 acceptablePrice,
        uint256 triggerPrice,
        uint256 minOutputAmount,
        Order.Props memory order
    ) external payable globalNonReentrant onlyController {
        FeatureUtils.validateFeature(dataStore, Keys.updateOrderFeatureDisabledKey(address(this), uint256(order.orderType())));
```
In the function above a malicious user can set and out of range trigger price to ensure the order cannot be executed.

When the malicious user sees the market has moved in a favorable position, he can simply update the trigger price.

Additionally the user can also front-run the order execution of the keeper and set the trigger price to ensure the order is not executed.

below we can observe how the trigger price is used when executing an order
```solidity
 // @dev executes an order
    // @param params BaseOrderUtils.ExecuteOrderParams
    function executeOrder(BaseOrderUtils.ExecuteOrderParams memory params) external {
        BaseOrderUtils.validateNonEmptyOrder(params.order);

        BaseOrderUtils.setExactOrderPrice(
            params.contracts.oracle,
            params.market.indexToken,
            params.order.orderType(),
            params.order.triggerPrice(),
            params.order.isLong()
        );
```
The function above then calls into `setExactOrderPrice`
```solidity
  if (shouldValidateAscendingPrice) {
                // check that the earlier price (primaryPrice) is smaller than the triggerPrice
                // and that the later price (secondaryPrice) is larger than the triggerPrice
                bool ok = primaryPrice <= triggerPrice && triggerPrice <= secondaryPrice;
                if (!ok) {
                    revert InvalidOrderPrices(primaryPrice, secondaryPrice, triggerPrice, shouldValidateAscendingPrice);
                }

                oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
                    triggerPrice, // min price that order can be executed with
                    secondaryPrice // max price that order can be executed with
                ));
            } else {
                // check that the earlier price (primaryPrice) is larger than the triggerPrice
                // and that the later price (secondaryPrice) is smaller than the triggerPrice
                bool ok = primaryPrice >= triggerPrice && triggerPrice >= secondaryPrice;
                if (!ok) {
                    revert InvalidOrderPrices(primaryPrice, secondaryPrice, triggerPrice, shouldValidateAscendingPrice);
                }

                oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
                    secondaryPrice, // min price that order can be executed with
                    triggerPrice // max price that order can be executed with
                ));
            }

            return;
```
From the logic above we can observe how if the trigger price is out of range, the order will not execute. Like i stated earlier the malicious user can then update trigger price if it is favorable for him, therefore creating a risk free trade.
## Impact
Malicious user can game the order system in order to create risk free trades. This is a loss of funds for the protocol and this is unfair to all the other users who use the protocol correctly. Users will lose trust in GMX.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to write logic in a way that mitigates this risk.
