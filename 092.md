# Malicious user can front-run createDeposit function to steal funds

## Summary
A malicious user can front run a users transaction and essentially steal his funds when the user calls `createDeposit`
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function createDeposit(
        DataStore dataStore,
        EventEmitter eventEmitter,
        DepositVault depositVault,
        address account,
        CreateDepositParams memory params
    ) external returns (bytes32) {
        Market.Props memory market = MarketUtils.getEnabledMarket(dataStore, params.market);

        uint256 initialLongTokenAmount = depositVault.recordTransferIn(params.initialLongToken);
        uint256 initialShortTokenAmount = depositVault.recordTransferIn(params.initialShortToken);

        address wnt = TokenUtils.wnt(dataStore);
```
In the code snippet above we can observe that the `createDeposit` function calls into MarketUtils.recordTransferIn. we can see that specific code snippet below.
```solidity
 // @dev records a token transfer into the contract
    // @param token the token to record the transfer for
    // @return the amount of tokens transferred in
    function recordTransferIn(address token) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
        return _recordTransferIn(token);
    }

    // @dev records a token transfer into the contract
    // @param token the token to record the transfer for
    // @return the amount of tokens transferred in
    function _recordTransferIn(address token) internal returns (uint256) {
        uint256 prevBalance = tokenBalances[token];
        uint256 nextBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        tokenBalances[token] = nextBalance;

        return nextBalance - prevBalance;
    }
```
Therefore, before a user can even call the `createDeposit` function, the user must transfer funds into the ExchangeRouter contract.
User A will deposit funds into the contract, Malicious user B can front run User A's `createDeposit` function, and User B will in turn call `createDeposit` with the funds of User A. Essentially stealing all of his funds.

While front-running is not possible on avalanche, it is in fact possible to front run on arbitrum and this can be done by uses th service linked below.

let me make a scenario to explain exactly how a malicious user will steal funds by front-running deposit of another unsuspecting user.

alice is your everyday ordinary user, and bob is malicious and wants to steal funds from alice. He can do so in the following way.

    Alice wants to create a deposit of 100 tokens, 

    before the token transfer, Alice's balance is 100 tokens

    after the token transfer, Alice's balance is 200 tokens in the exchange router.

    Alice want to perform the deposit and will call the createDeposit function

    Bob then can call createDeposit and frontrun the deposit using Alice's balance, essentially stealing her funds.

## Impact
A malicious user can front-run and unsuspecting user's deposit and steal all of his funds.
