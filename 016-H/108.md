# Incorrect prices used for orders

## Summary

For certain order types, primary prices are used for order execution instead of secondary prices, potentially allowing a user to make an order with knowledge of price that will be used to execute the order and hence be guaranteed a profit.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Comment for function `setExactOrderPrice() `explicitly states that `secondaryPrices` should be used for setting `customPrice`
```solidity
// for market orders, set the min and max values of the customPrice for the indexToken
// to either secondaryPrice.min or secondaryPrice.max depending on whether the order
// is an increase or decrease and whether it is for a long or short
```
2. However logic in the function uses primary prices instead for `MarketIncrease`, `MarketDecrease` and `Liquidation` orders
```solidity
if (orderType == Order.OrderType.MarketIncrease ||
    orderType == Order.OrderType.MarketDecrease ||
    orderType == Order.OrderType.Liquidation) {

    Price.Props memory price = oracle.getPrimaryPrice(indexToken);

    oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
        price.pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice),
        price.pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice)
    ));

    return;
}
```
3. Secondary prices are second occurrences of a token's price from the source, and hence the latest one - comments in Oracle.sol also mention that primary and secondary prices can be from different block numbers.

## Impact
So the use of primaryPrices can be seen as using a stale price compared to secondary price and someone can make a trade with knowledge of this stale price to make a profit.

## Code Snippet

LoC: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol#L224-L236

```solidity
if (orderType == Order.OrderType.MarketIncrease ||
    orderType == Order.OrderType.MarketDecrease ||
    orderType == Order.OrderType.Liquidation) {

    Price.Props memory price = oracle.getPrimaryPrice(indexToken);

    oracle.setCustomPrice(indexToken, Price.Props(
        price.pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice),
        price.pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice)
    ));

    return;
}
```

## Recommendation

Use `secondaryPrice` instead of `primaryPrice` for the order types highlighted above in setting the `customPrice` for order execution, as per comment
