# withdrawal estimates a higher gas limit than intended

## Summary
When withdrawing, withdrawal gas limit is estimated. However, an edge case can cause withdrawal gas limit estimates to be higher than intended. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `createWithdrawal`, notice that gas limit is estimated.

```solidity
        uint256 estimatedGasLimit = GasUtils.estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit(dataStore, withdrawal);
```

However when getting the withdrawalGasLimitKey, it is hardcoded to fetch non single token withdrawal gas limit amount. 
```solidity
    function estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit(DataStore dataStore, Withdrawal.Props memory withdrawal) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return dataStore.getUint(Keys.withdrawalGasLimitKey(false)) + withdrawal.callbackGasLimit();
    }
```

If market uses only one token and either side long or short is empty, withdrawalGasLimitKey will return a higher gas limit than it intends for one token market and hence the withdrawal gas limit estimates will be higher than intended. 
```solidity
    function withdrawalGasLimitKey(bool singleToken) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encode(
            WITHDRAWAL_GAS_LIMIT,
            singleToken
        ));
    }
```
## Impact
Withdrawal gas limit will be higher than intended.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend checking if either side is empty and apply accordingly to the parameter of withdrawalGasLimitKey.
