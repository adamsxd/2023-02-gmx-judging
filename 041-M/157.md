# Position fees are still assessed even if the ability to decrease positions is disabled

## Summary

Position fees (borrowing and funding) are still assessed even if the ability to decrease positions is disabled


## Vulnerability Detail

Config keepers have the ability to disable order placement and order execution, and them doing so does not pause the state of position fees.


## Impact

Users will be assessed position fees even if they wished to close their positions, and can be liquidated through no fault of their own.


## Code Snippet

Order creation (to close a position) may be disabled:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol : OrderHandler.createOrder()   #1

43:           FeatureUtils.validateFeature(dataStore, Keys.createOrderFeatureDisabledKey(address(this), uint256(params.orderType)));
```

As may execution of orders prior to the disabling of creation:

```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol : OrderHandler._executeOrder()   #2

207:           FeatureUtils.validateFeature(params.contracts.dataStore, Keys.executeOrderFeatureDisabledKey(address(this), uint256(params.order.orderType())));
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol#L197-L210

But position fees are tracked based on time and do not account for pauses:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol : MarketUtils.updatedAt   #3

1759        function getSecondsSinceCumulativeBorrowingFactorUpdated(DataStore dataStore, address market, bool isLong) internal view returns (uint256) {
1760            uint256 updatedAt = getCumulativeBorrowingFactorUpdatedAt(dataStore, market, isLong);
1761            if (updatedAt == 0) { return 0; }
1762 @>         return block.timestamp - updatedAt;
1763:       }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1759-L1763

```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol : MarketUtils.getSecondsSinceFundingUpdated()   #4

1658        function getSecondsSinceFundingUpdated(DataStore dataStore, address market) internal view returns (uint256) {
1659            uint256 updatedAt = dataStore.getUint(Keys.fundingUpdatedAtKey(market));
1660            if (updatedAt == 0) { return 0; }
1661 @>         return block.timestamp - updatedAt;
1662:       }
```

## Recommendation

Track and account for disabling, and adjust position fees based on whether things were paused or not.
