# Funds will be stuck if user is blacklisted by assets token contract

## Summary
User's fund will be stuck after creating a deposit if he gets blacklisted by assets token contract. An example would USDC, if a user gets blacklisted by USDC contract after creating a deposit with long or short tokens that is USDC, the deposit will be stuck as user is unable to call `cancelDeposit`. This also applies to executeWithdrawal where it will always revert due to the transfer of blacklisted token always reverting.

## Vulnerability Detail

Notice that when user calls `cancelDeposit`, vault transfers directly to `deposit` account, which is the msg.sender that created the deposit request. In the event that user gets blacklisted by assets token contract after calling `createDeposit`, `cancelDeposit` will revert as the transfer of tokens will fail.

```solidity
        if (deposit.initialLongTokenAmount() > 0) {
            depositVault.transferOut(
                deposit.initialLongToken(),
                deposit.account(),
                deposit.initialLongTokenAmount(),
                deposit.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()
            );
        }


        if (deposit.initialShortTokenAmount() > 0) {
            depositVault.transferOut(
                deposit.initialShortToken(),
                deposit.account(),
                deposit.initialShortTokenAmount(),
                deposit.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()
            );
```



## Impact
Funds will be stuck for user who is blacklisted by assets token contract.
