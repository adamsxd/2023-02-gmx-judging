# Orders with single-sided deposits that are auto-adjusted, always revert part 2

## Summary

Deposits of only the long collateral token, when doing so results in an auto-adjustment of the order to minimize price impact, results in the order always reverting, in another way.


## Vulnerability Detail

The adjustment logic is wrong, leading to the function reverting

## Impact

Single sided deposits as a feature are completely broken when the deposit doesn't solely push the swap impact towards a lower value.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol : ExecuteDepositUtils.getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts()   #1

381        function getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts(
382            DataStore dataStore,
383            Market.Props memory market,
384 @>         uint256 longTokenAmount
385        ) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
386            uint256 poolLongTokenAmount = MarketUtils.getPoolAmount(dataStore, market.marketToken, market.longToken);
387            uint256 poolShortTokenAmount = MarketUtils.getPoolAmount(dataStore, market.marketToken, market.shortToken);
388    
389            uint256 adjustedLongTokenAmount;
390            uint256 adjustedShortTokenAmount;
391    
392            if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount) {
393                uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;
394    
395                if (diff < poolLongTokenAmount) {
396 @>                 adjustedLongTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
397 @>                 adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount - adjustedLongTokenAmount;
398                } else {
399:                   adjustedLongTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
```

See the following example input:
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract It is Test {
    function testIt() external pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 longTokenAmount = 10;
        uint256 poolLongTokenAmount = 500;
        uint256 poolShortTokenAmount = 200;
        uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;
        uint256 adjustedLongTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
	return adjustedLongTokenAmount;
    }
}
```

This is the output:
```shell
$ forge test -vvv

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Revisit the price adjustment logic, since it reverts when `longTokenAmount` is smaller than the pool's imbalance, and still doesn't give the right answer when it's larger
