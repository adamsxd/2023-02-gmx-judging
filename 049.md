# _validateRange in Config does not check the input value as described

## Summary
`_validateRange` in Config does not check the input value as described

## Vulnerability Detail
in the dev note of this function `_validateRange` : it said  `// @dev validate that the value is within the allowed range`. However in the function itself the value is only used in sending revert message, but not used in any check against a pre-set boundary.


## Impact
function does not verify the input value is within an expected range
