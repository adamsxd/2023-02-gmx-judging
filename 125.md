# Simulations should not be used

## Summary

if Simulations are used to check if execution are successful, then it is more profitable for the keeper to attempt to execute the operation then simulate it since simulations ALWAYS revert and waste gas while executions will pay the keeper back execution fee and rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

Simulations such as `simulateExecuteDeposit` will always revert even if an execution is successful.

A lot of gas will be wasted since the revert is after all the execution logic. 

It is wiser to call the real `executeDeposit` or any other operation because even if the execution fails, the execution fee and rewards will be paid out to the keeper instead of losing gas funds.

## Impact

Loss of gas

## Recommendation

Since there is no profit from calling any simulation function consider removing them.
