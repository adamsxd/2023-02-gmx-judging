# Price impact parameters could lead to risk-free profit opportunities for users

## Summary

Incorrect relationship between two admin parameters could lead to risk-free profit opportunities for users.
NB: the finding is not about specific values for admin parameters, but rather the relationship between two admin parameters that are set.

## Vulnerability Detail

J_0 is for `dataStore.getUint(Keys.positionImpactFactorKey(market, hasPositiveImpact=false))`

J_1 is for `dataStore.getUint(Keys.positionImpactFactorKey(market, hasPositiveImpact=true))`

This graph shows that, if J_1 < J_0 then a user can do first: a long market increase order; and second: another long market increase order and get a guaranteed increase in execution price.

**NB: see Desmos graphs for mathematical proof**

## Impact

A user has 100% guarantee of profit if going long if `(J_0 - J_1)` (defined above) is positive.

Hence a malicious actor could use very large positions to make a risk-free profit and drain funds from other users' balances.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommendation here would be to force J_0 < J_1
