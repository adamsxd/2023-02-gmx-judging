# Missing freshness check in getLatestPrice() function in oracle.sol

## Summary
There is no freshness check in the getLatestPrice() function and latestRoundData in _setPricesFromPriceFeeds() function in oracle.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check to make sure that the prices delivered by getLatestPrice() function and latestRoundData in _setPricesFromPriceFeeds() function isn't stale.

## Impact
The current implementation of getLatestPrice() lacks a freshness check, which could result in the use of stale prices.
In the event of a rapid drop in the market price of the token (commonly known as "flash crashes"), if the secondaryPrice and primaryPrice is not updated in a timely manner, the smart contract may continue to believe that the token is worth more than it's actual market value.
Using stale prices can cause losses for users.


Also latestRoundData in _setPricesFromPriceFeeds() function should also implement a freshness check

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend that oracle.sol should have a  'latestTimestamp' and 'oldTimestamp' variable and compare and track them in a way it ensures that the prices gotten from getLatestPrice() is indeed the latest price.
