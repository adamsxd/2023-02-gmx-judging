# Oracle._setPricesFromPriceFeeds can get stale price from oracle

## Summary
Oracle._setPricesFromPriceFeeds can get stale price from oracle
## Vulnerability Detail
`Oracle._setPricesFromPriceFeeds` function uses price feed to fetch price of token.
When it receives price, it doesn't check that this [price is valid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol#L571-L577) in the current moment. The function only uses price param.

However, this price can be already not fresh and not up to date price will be set to `primaryPrices` and will be used for calculations.
## Impact
Not fresh price will be fetched.
