# estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit() Missing included gasForSwaps

## Summary

withdraw does not contain gasForSwaps malicious users can construct a very large SwapPath, malicious consumption orderKeeper gas costs
 
## Vulnerability Detail

The longTokenSwapPath/minLongTokenAmount path can be specified when used for withdrawals.
However, the estimated withdrawal fee does not include swap gas
The estimated codes are as follows
```solidity
    function estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit(DataStore dataStore, Withdrawal.Props memory withdrawal) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return dataStore.getUint(Keys.withdrawalGasLimitKey(false)) + withdrawal.callbackGasLimit();//@audit <-------don't include gasForSwaps 
    }
```

We can find estimateExecuteDepositGasLimit/estimateExecuteOrderGasLimit etc.'s are included.
I think this one also needs to be included
Because if not included, a malicious attacker, can set a very long SwapPath, consume the gas cost but not take the loss



## Impact

Consuming large amounts of gas from the OrderKeeper

## Recommendation
```solidity
    function estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit(DataStore dataStore, Withdrawal.Props memory withdrawal) internal view returns (uint256) {
-       return dataStore.getUint(Keys.withdrawalGasLimitKey(false)) + withdrawal.callbackGasLimit();
+       uint256 gasPerSwap = dataStore.getUint(Keys.singleSwapGasLimitKey());
+       uint256 swapCount = withdrawal.longTokenSwapPath().length + withdrawal.shortTokenSwapPath().length;
+       uint256 gasForSwaps = swapCount * gasPerSwap;
+       return dataStore.getUint(Keys.withdrawalGasLimitKey(false)) + withdrawal.callbackGasLimit() + gasForSwaps;
    }
```
