# GasUtils.estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit calculates gas amount incorrectly

## Summary
GasUtils.estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit calculates gas amount incorrectly, so user can pay less amount for gas
## Vulnerability Detail
`GasUtils.estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit` function is used to calculate amount of gas that is needed to execute withdrawal order.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/gas/GasUtils.sol#L149-L151
```solidity
    function estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit(DataStore dataStore, Withdrawal.Props memory withdrawal) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return dataStore.getUint(Keys.withdrawalGasLimitKey(false)) + withdrawal.callbackGasLimit();
    }
```
As you can see function only calculates withdrawal gas limit and callback.
But when user wants to make withdraw, he can also swap his short/long tokens [for another tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/withdrawal/WithdrawalUtils.sol#L354-L374).
So i believe that `estimateExecuteWithdrawalGasLimit` function should calculate similar to `estimateExecuteDepositGasLimit` function, which [handles situations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/gas/GasUtils.sol#L135-L137) when long/short token should be swapped.
## Impact
Order creator underpays for withdrawal order, so keepers will not be interested in such orders.

## Recommendation
Use similar approach as in `estimateExecuteDepositGasLimit` function.
