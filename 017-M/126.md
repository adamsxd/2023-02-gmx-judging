# No check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down when receiving prices from price feeds

## Summary

The oracle passes price feeds for tokens to determine some token prices.

The price received from the feed could be stale and does not check if the Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down.

## Vulnerability Detail

When setting the price from the price feeds, the `latestRoundData` is called without checking if the price is fresh or if the sequencer is down.

That is against Chainlink recommendations.

## Impact

Since the price feeds can potentially be stale - possible order execution could have an incorrect pricing outcome.
