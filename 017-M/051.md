# Oracle is not checking for sequencer uptime

## Summary

The ArbitrumSequencer can allow tx to be queued while the L2 is offline, these will pass the freshness check but use outdated prices



## Vulnerability Detail

Because of how Arbitrum works, if the L2 goes offline, tx can still be sent via the [Delayed inbox](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f) on L1.

This could allow the creation of orders which use prices from when the Sequencer was down, which would still pass the freshness check, but may be incorrect or outdated

## Impact

Due to the price not being up-to-date, a leak of value may happen, for example a position could be opened while already knowing what the future value of the oracle will be, ensuring a payout at the detriment of LPs

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the check for the Sequencer being online, see the CL docs for more details:
