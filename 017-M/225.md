# potentially using old price from pricefeed in oracle due to unchecked timestamp difference

## Summary

potentially using old price from pricefeed in oracle due to unchecked timestamp difference

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
            (
                /* uint80 roundID */,
                int256 _price,
                /* uint256 startedAt */,
                /* uint256 timestamp */,
                /* uint80 answeredInRound */
            ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

here, timestamp can be any value in past, if difference b/w timestamp and current timestamp is high then the price is stale and should be adjusted further (or should not be used)

## Impact

if external price feed does not update due to whatever reason (sequencer issues, operation issues, congestion, etc.) then oracles uses stale price feed to settle position and trades.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- use sequencer uptime check
- use threshold check on returned timestamp vs current timestamp
