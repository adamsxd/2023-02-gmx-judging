# Users that have to claim collateral more than once for a time slot, may get the wrong total amount

## Summary

Users that have to claim collateral more than once for a given time slot, may get the wrong total amount, because the amount claimed is incorrectly set


## Vulnerability Detail

When letting a user claim his/her collateral, the code looks up the claimable amount, does an adjustment based on a factor, sends that amount to the user, then updates the remaining amount claimable. The code incorrectly sets the factor-adjusted total claimable amount as the amount claimed, rather than the claimable amount.

## Impact

Accounting of the claimed amount will be wrong, and the user will get less collateral back than they deserve, in some cases.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol : MarketUtils.claimCollateral()   #1

631 @>         uint256 adjustedClaimableAmount = Precision.applyFactor(claimableAmount, claimableFactor);
632            if (adjustedClaimableAmount <= claimedAmount) { // @audit fixed comparison operator as mentioned in a separate issue
633                revert CollateralAlreadyClaimed(adjustedClaimableAmount, claimedAmount);
634            }
635    
636 @>         uint256 remainingClaimableAmount = adjustedClaimableAmount - claimedAmount;
637    
638            dataStore.setUint(
639                Keys.claimedCollateralAmountKey(market, token, timeKey, account),
640 @>             adjustedClaimableAmount
641            );
642    
643            MarketToken(payable(market)).transferOut(
644                token,
645                receiver,
646                remainingClaimableAmount
647:           );
```

- A user triggers claimable collateral for 1 Eth (`claimableAmount` = 1)
- A keeper sets `claimableFactor` to 1.0
- The user calls claim, and gets the full 1 Eth, and `claimedAmount` becomes 1 (`adjustedClaimableAmount`)
- A keeper sets `claimableFactor` to 0.5 for that time slot
- The user triggers more claimable collateral for 1 Eth (`claimableAmount` = 2) for the same time slot
- The user calls claim. `adjustedClaimableAmount` is 2 * 0.5 = 1, `remainingClaimableAmount` is 1 - 1 = 0, so the user can't claim anything

The user should have been able to claim a total of 1.5 Eth, but was only able to claim the original 1 Eth, and then nothing more.
