# chain libraray has references to deprecated arbitrum rinkeby which causes uninteded behaviour for block values

## Summary

chain libraray has references to deprecated arbitrum rinkeby which causes uninteded behaviour for block values

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
uint256 constant public ARBITRUM_RINKEBY_CHAIN_ID = 421611;
```
arbitrum rinkeby is deprecated in favour of arbitrum goerli

## Impact

if protocol is deployed in arbitrum goerli, it will not use `ArbSys` and use default block values which would not revert but silently causes issues in execution, `blockhash` on arbitrum goerli will return pseudo-random value and will not be able to verify oracle updates.

## Recommendation
use arbitrum goerli chain-id
