# Order creator can be a contract that spends all gas when receives funds, that will make tx more costly for executor

## Summary
Order creator can be a contract that spends all gas when receives funds, that will make tx more costly for executor.
## Vulnerability Detail
When executor executes order, then gas amount that he spends for that transaction is compensated for him. This is done inside `GasUtils.payExecutionFee` function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/gas/GasUtils.sol#L41-L74
```solidity
    function payExecutionFee(
        DataStore dataStore,
        StrictBank bank,
        uint256 executionFee,
        uint256 startingGas,
        address keeper,
        address user
    ) external {
        uint256 gasUsed = startingGas - gasleft();
        uint256 executionFeeForKeeper = adjustGasUsage(dataStore, gasUsed) * tx.gasprice;


        if (executionFeeForKeeper > executionFee) {
            executionFeeForKeeper = executionFee;
        }


        bank.transferOutNativeToken(
            keeper,
            executionFeeForKeeper
        );


        emit KeeperExecutionFee(keeper, executionFeeForKeeper);


        uint256 refundFeeForUser = executionFee - executionFeeForKeeper;
        if (refundFeeForUser == 0) {
            return;
        }


        bank.transferOutNativeToken(
            user,
            refundFeeForUser
        );


        emit UserRefundFee(user, refundFeeForUser);
    }
```
The function calculates amount of gas, that was spent till that moment and then pays fee to executor and pays funds that were unused back to fee payer(makes refund). Refunding part will be paid by executor in this case.

Now we need to investigate, how refund is sent to order creator. `bank.transferOutNativeToken` is used for that. This function [then calls `TokenUtils.withdrawAndSendNativeToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/bank/Bank.sol#L117-L122) function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/token/TokenUtils.sol#L120-L143
```solidity
    function withdrawAndSendNativeToken(
        DataStore dataStore,
        address _wnt,
        address receiver,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        if (amount == 0) { return; }
        ReceiverUtils.validateReceiver(receiver);


        IWNT(_wnt).withdraw(amount);


        uint256 gasLimit = dataStore.getUint(Keys.NATIVE_TOKEN_TRANSFER_GAS_LIMIT);


        (bool success, /* bytes memory data */) = payable(receiver).call{ value: amount, gas: gasLimit }("");


        if (success) { return; }


        // if the transfer failed, re-wrap the token and it to the receiver
        depositAndSendWrappedNativeToken(
            dataStore,
            receiver,
            amount
        );
    }
```
This function tries to send native tokens to refunder and it spends maximum `Keys.NATIVE_TOKEN_TRANSFER_GAS_LIMIT` amount of gas. In case call is not successful, then it will call `depositAndSendWrappedNativeToken` which will send that amount as wrapped native token, so actually it will again deposit to wnt and then make transfer.

So all that manipulations is additional gas usage which will be not compensated to executor.
So attacker can use a contract in order to create orders. This contract will have receive function, that will spend all gas, that is sent to it, so `Keys.NATIVE_TOKEN_TRANSFER_GAS_LIMIT` amount of gas will be paid by fee executor, also sending refunds as wrapped native token(depositing and transfering to refunder) will be also paid by executor.

## Impact
Executor will receive less amount for execution, so this will be not profitable for him.
