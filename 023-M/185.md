# Order keepers can use oracle prices from far in the past

## Summary

The readme states that `Order keepers and frozen order keepers could potentially extract value through transaction ordering, delayed transaction execution etc, this will be partially mitigated with a keeper network`. That mitigation solves delayed order, but does not prevent immediate execution using old prices.


## Vulnerability Detail

Market orders allow prices in the past, and a keeper may use a price further in the past than is necessary, in order to gain some advantage (e.g. a kickback). There is a [limit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol#L438) but in a fast-moving market, prices can change a lot.


## Impact

A better price for one user means a worse price for the other side of the trade, and larger losses.


## Code Snippet

Market orders are allowed to use prices from before the order was submitted:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/IncreaseOrderUtils.sol : IncreaseOrderUtils.validateOracleBlockNumbers()   #1

90             uint256[] memory minOracleBlockNumbers,
91             uint256[] memory maxOracleBlockNumbers,

94             uint256 positionIncreasedAtBlock
95         ) internal view {
96             if (orderType == Order.OrderType.MarketIncrease) {
97  @>             OracleUtils.validateBlockNumberWithinRange(
98                     minOracleBlockNumbers,
99                     maxOracleBlockNumbers,
100                    orderUpdatedAtBlock
101                );
102                return;
103:           }

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Require the keeper to provide a signature from the oracle archive node stating that there is no price available closer to the given block
