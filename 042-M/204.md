# Variable subtracted where it should be assigned leads to `getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts()` reverting.

## Summary
`adjustedLongTokenAmount` is subtracted where it should be initialized, leading to the call reverting with an underflow error, which means `executeDeposit` will revert in some cases.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function calculates the adjusted token amounts that would minimize the price impact.
In the `poolLongTokenAmount >= poolShortTokenAmount` block, there is a subtraction where an assignment should be line 406

```solidity
File: contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol
389:       uint256 adjustedLongTokenAmount;
390:         uint256 adjustedShortTokenAmount;
391: 
392:         if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount) { 
393:             uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;
394: 
395:             if (diff < poolLongTokenAmount) {
396:                 adjustedLongTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
397:                 adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount - adjustedLongTokenAmount;
398:             } else {
399:                 adjustedLongTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
400:             }
401:         } else {
402:             uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;
403: 
404:             if (diff < poolShortTokenAmount) {
405:                 adjustedShortTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
406:                 adjustedLongTokenAmount - longTokenAmount - adjustedShortTokenAmount;//@audit should be = 
407:             } else {
408:                 adjustedLongTokenAmount = 0;
409:                 adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
410:             }
411:         }

```

This line below will always revert, as `adjustedLongTokenAmount` is not initialized, meaning ` adjustedLongTokenAmount - longTokenAmount` will underflow.
```solidity
 adjustedLongTokenAmount - longTokenAmount - adjustedShortTokenAmount;
```

Note: currently the call reverts beforehand because of another error (handling of the `poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount` cases), which is detailed in another report. Once you have fixed it, the call will revert line 406 because of the problem described in this report.

## Impact
`getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts()` always reverts in the case where `poolLongTokenAmount >= poolShortTokenAmount` for markets where `market.longToken == market.shortToken`.
