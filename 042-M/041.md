# loss of funds to user when depositing in a market that uses the same long token and short token

## Summary
When depositing in a market that uses the same long token and short token, there is a case that can cause user to lose out on market tokens due to a coding error. Note that this requires another bug to be fixed that will always cause getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts to revert due to incorrect diff calculation. Another report will be submitted for that bug.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts`, notice [ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L406](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L406). I believe that = is miscoded as -.
```solidity
     adjustedLongTokenAmount - longTokenAmount - adjustedShortTokenAmount;
```

Hence, adjustedLongTokenAmount will be its default value of 0 and hence longTokenAmount is 0.

```solidity
            (cache.longTokenAmount, cache.shortTokenAmount) = getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts(
```

Even though at the end of `executeDeposit`, there is a minimum check. However, the check is for slippage protection and some users might set to no slippage  and hence this check is not a good prevention of loss of funds for user.

```solidity
        if (cache.receivedMarketTokens < deposit.minMarketTokens()) {
```

## Impact

When depositing in market that uses same token for long and short tokens, user will receive lesser market tokens than intended if poolLongTokenAmount is more than poolShortTokenAmount.

## Linked issues 
1. getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts will always revert
2. DOS to executeDeposit if diff is more than longTokenAmount

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend correcting the error

```diff
-     adjustedLongTokenAmount - longTokenAmount - adjustedShortTokenAmount;
+    adjustedLongTokenAmount = longTokenAmount - adjustedShortTokenAmount;
```
