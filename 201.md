# User deposits can be lost if deposits are not crafted carefully

## Summary
A user depositing ERC20 tokens into strict bank, then subsequently calling `createDeposit` can be front run by a malicious party taking all of their deposit. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In `exchangeRouter`, the `createDeposit` function states the following:
@dev Creates a new deposit with the given long token, short token, long token amount, short token
     * amount, and deposit parameters. The deposit is created by transferring the specified amounts of
     * long and short tokens from the caller's account to the deposit store, and then calling the
     * `createDeposit()` function on the deposit handler contract.
     *
If this process is not carried out atomically through a multicall or some carefully structured contract, once the user sends the specified long or short tokens, another user is able to call `createDeposit()` before the original user, claiming all of their collateral. 

## Impact
A user who tried to transfer ERC20 tokens to the deposit store then subsequently call create deposit without carefully crafting a multicall will have their entire deposit lost by a front runner who claims the deposit on their behalf. 

## Code Snippet

One can see that `recordTranferIn` simply checks the balance increased in the contracts and credits that to whoever first calls `createDeposit`. If sending of the ERC20 tokens to this deposit store ever happens non-atomically with the createDeposit call, the user stands to lose all their deposit. This is not stated clearly anywhere and its a conceivable scenario for a user to first transfer their ERC20 tokens before calling create deposit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `createDeposit` code could call the ERC20 transfers within the scope of the function to avoid this ever being a nasty scenario that could take place.
