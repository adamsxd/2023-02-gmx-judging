# DepositHandler.cancel doesn't have receiver field

## Summary
DepositHandler.cancel doesn't have receiver field. In case if user used initial token that have blocking mechanism and he will be blocked, then he will not be able to cancel deposit.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user creates deposit order, then he provides execution fee for the keeper who will execute his order. In case if gas price has increased, then keepers will not execute that order first, till gas cost will reduce. 
It's possible for user to cancel his deposit [after some amount of blocks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L71-L75) has passed, since deposit order creation.

To cancel deposit user can call `DepositHandler.cancel` function, which will send [initialTokenAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/DepositUtils.sol#L72-L73) that user wanted to deposit and executionFee [back to order creator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/DepositUtils.sol#L162-L178).
But in case if user deposited initial token that has blocking mechanism and user was blocked between deposit order creation and canceling, then he will not be able to cancel deposit and tx will revert.

This is possible scenario when user loses his funds because of that.
1.User created deposit order and provided executionFee.
2.Gas price has increased, so user's deposit is not profitable right now and keepers do not execute it.
3.User was blacklisted by initial token that has blocking mechanism.
4.To make his deposit order attractive for keepers, user needs to increase executionFee. To do that he needs to cancel his order, receive back initial tokens, he sent and create new order with bigger executionFee.
5.But now user can't cancel his order as he is blocked, so his order has stucked, till gas price will become smaller.
## Impact
User can't cancel his deposit if he used initial token that can block accounts and he was blocked.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add additional field `recipient`, that will be used to sent funds.
