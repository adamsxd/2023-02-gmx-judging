# Incorrect implementation of the getBorrowingFee

## Summary

Incorrect implementation of getBorrowingFee

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the documentation

https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics#borrowing-fees

> There is a borrowing fee paid to liquidity providers, this helps prevent users from opening both long and short positions to take up pool capacity without paying any fees.

> Borrowing fees are calculated as borrowing factor * (open interest in usd + pending pnl) ^ (borrowing exponent factor) / (pool usd) for longs and borrowing factor * (open interest in usd) ^ (borrowing exponent factor) / (pool usd) for shorts.

> For example if the borrowing factor per second is 1 / 50,000, and the borrowing exponent factor is 1, and the long open interest is $150,000 with +$50,000 of pending pnl, and the pool has $250,000 worth of tokens, the borrowing fee per second for longs would be (1 / 50,000) * (150,000 + 50,000) / 250,000 => 0.000016 => 0.0016%

However, the implementation does not implement the formula above strictly:

In PositionPricingUtils.sol#getPositionFees

```solidity
fees.borrowingFeeAmount = MarketUtils.getBorrowingFees(dataStore, position) / collateralTokenPrice.min;
```

calling

In gmx-synthetics\contracts\market\MarketUtils.sol

```solidity
    // @dev get the borrowing fees for a position, assumes that cumulativeBorrowingFactor
    // has already been updated to the latest value
    // @param dataStore DataStore
    // @param position Position.Props
    // @return the borrowing fees for a position
    function getBorrowingFees(DataStore dataStore, Position.Props memory position) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 cumulativeBorrowingFactor = getCumulativeBorrowingFactor(dataStore, position.market(), position.isLong());
        if (position.borrowingFactor() > cumulativeBorrowingFactor) {
            revert UnexpectedBorrowingFactor(position.borrowingFactor(), cumulativeBorrowingFactor);
        }
        uint256 diffFactor = cumulativeBorrowingFactor - position.borrowingFactor();
        return Precision.applyFactor(position.sizeInUsd(), diffFactor);
    }
```

The vulnerability is related to the incorrect implementation of the getBorrowingFee function in the MarketUtils.sol contract of the gmx-synthetics project. According to the documentation, borrowing fees should be calculated based on a formula that takes into account the borrowing factor, open interest in USD, pending PNL, and pool USD. However, the implementation in the getPositionFees function in the PositionPricingUtils.sol contract uses a different calculation that divides the result by collateralTokenPrice.min.

Also the borrowing fee does not distinguish between long and short position and take the pending pnl into consideration when calculating the PNL for long position as stated in the formula doc.

## Impact

This deviation from the documented formula can result in inaccurate borrowing fees being charged to users. This can potentially allow users to open both long and short positions without paying the correct amount of fees, which can harm liquidity providers and result in financial losses for the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, the getPositionFees function in PositionPricingUtils.sol should be updated to implement the correct formula for calculating borrowing fees as specified in the documentation.
