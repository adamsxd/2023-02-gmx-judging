# gas usage while updating prices in oracles scales linearly with singers and tokens

## Summary

gas usage while updating prices in oracles scales linearly with singers and tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

while updating prices in oracle, following in process:
(N = no. of signers, M = no, of tokens)

- check for duplicate and max signers => O(N)
- iterate over each token and verify price data and sorting for each signer => O(M x N)
- for each token query chainlink price feed => O(M)
- clear all tokens => O(M)

with heavy storage read-writes and external calls, this does not scale more than block gas limit and if it is done in chunks then prices would not be precise (for e.g tokenA can be updated in 1st chunk and tokenB is updated in 2nd chunk while there can be execution in market consisting tokenA and tokenB at stale price)

## Impact

1) if chunked, trade execution can happen at stale price
2) else cannot have more than certain threshold of market and keepers (limited by block gas limit) and may result in delayed confirmation when submitting large block payload (because of capacity required)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

move some of the components offchain (for e.g sorting) and / or post only merkle root consting all signatures
