# Try catch clause in the system may process partial logic of a function halfway

## Summary
Every code in a function should be either all get executed or all not get executed. However, try catch clause in the system may process partial logic of a function halfway.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take the following executeOrder function as an example

```solidity
       try this._executeOrder(
            key,
            oracleParams,
            msg.sender,
            startingGas
        ) {
        } catch (bytes memory reasonBytes) {
            _handleOrderError(key, startingGas, reasonBytes);
        }
```        

The code in executeOrder function is long. Assume that error is thrown in line 5, all the code BEFORE LINE 5 together with the code in the catch clause will get executed.

## Impact
Supposedly, we should revert all the code in the function if error thrown and only execute the code in the catch clause, some code is executed in the function is executed and we do not want this. System may behave in an unintended way if partial logic of a function is executed.

[and other code which has try-catch clause]

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't use try-catch clause. Use alternative way so that no code will be executed. 

There are several ways to fix this. Let's take order as an example, 
 
During the order execution phase, don't cancel or frozen the order directly if error is thrown.
We can add a timestamp to the order for every order creation activity.
if the order cannot be executed within the allowed timestamp, then only allow it to be cancelled or executed.
[Here, we assume that the order will be executed within the allowed timestamp but error thrown]
