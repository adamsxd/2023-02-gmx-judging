# If block range it big and adl dosnt use currentblock in the order it will cause issues

## Summary

if block range is a big range and since adl order uses` cache.minOracleBlockNumbers[0]` there can be an issue of the block not being in range because of the littlest block with max block being a lot bigger and adl wont happen and the protocol will get bad debt

## Vulnerability Detail

since the adl order updateBlock is `cache.minOracleBlockNumbers[0]` the block can be behind the  range check and fail and the protocol can end up in bad debt with the tokens price declining

## Impact

bad debt

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        cache.key = AdlUtils.createAdlOrder(
            AdlUtils.CreateAdlOrderParams(
                dataStore,
                eventEmitter,
                account,
                market,
                collateralToken,
                isLong,
                sizeDeltaUsd,
                cache.minOracleBlockNumbers[0]
            )
