# getFundingFeeAmount() returns the wrong truth value for ``hasPendingFundingFee`` due to logical error.

## Summary
``getFundingFeeAmount()`` returns the wrong truth value for ``hasPendingFundingFee`` due to logical error. It might return false for ``hasPendingFundingFee``  when it is supposed to return true. 


## Vulnerability Detail
The ``getFundingFeeAmount()`` function  will return  ``hasPendingFundingFee`` to indicate if there is a non-zero  pending funding fee even though the current funding fee is zero. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1237-L1246](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1237-L1246)

However, from the last line, one can see there is a logical error: 
```javascipt
return (fundingDiffFactor != 0 && amount == 0, amount);
```
It will return true even when ``amount == 0``, and return false when it is supposed to return true.
This is because of the wrong condition ``amount == 0``, which is supposed to be ``amount != 0``.


## Impact
``getFundingFeeAmount()`` returns the wrong truth value for ``hasPendingFundingFee`` due to logical error. 

This might affect many wrong calculation of the protocol when ``getFundingFeeAmount()`` is used.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Correction is as follows:
```diff
function getFundingFeeAmount(
        int256 latestFundingAmountPerSize,
        int256 positionFundingAmountPerSize,
        uint256 positionSizeInUsd
    ) internal pure returns (bool, int256) {
        int256 fundingDiffFactor = (latestFundingAmountPerSize - positionFundingAmountPerSize);
        int256 amount = Precision.applyFactor(positionSizeInUsd, fundingDiffFactor);

-        return (fundingDiffFactor != 0 && amount == 0, amount);
+        return (fundingDiffFactor != 0 && amount != 0, amount);

    }
```
