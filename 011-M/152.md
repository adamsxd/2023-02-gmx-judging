# Oracles are vulnerable to cross-chain replay attacks

## Summary

Oracles are vulnerable to cross-chain replay attacks


## Vulnerability Detail

If there's a hard fork (e.g. miner vs proof of stake), signatures/txns submitted on one chain can be replayed on the other chain.


## Impact

Keepers on the forked chain can use oracle prices from the original chain, even though they may not be correct for the current chain (e.g. USDC's price on the fork may be worth zero until Circle adds support on that fork), leading to invalid execution prices and or liquidations.


## Code Snippet

The `SALT` used in signatures is hard-coded to an immutable variable in the constructor, and uses the `block.chainid` from the time of construction:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol : Oracle.constructor()   #1

108        constructor(
109            RoleStore _roleStore,
110            OracleStore _oracleStore
111        ) RoleModule(_roleStore) {
112            oracleStore = _oracleStore;
113    
114            // sign prices with only the chainid and oracle name so that there is
115            // less config required in the oracle nodes
116 @>         SALT = keccak256(abi.encode(block.chainid, "xget-oracle-v1"));
117:       }
```

Signatures use the [`SALT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/OracleUtils.sol#L257) without also including the `block.chainid` separately


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Include the `block.chainid` in the signature, separately from the `SALT`, and ensure that the value is looked up each time
