# There are no checks for which roles are being granted

## Summary
There are no checks which roles are being granted through out the codebase, allowing for granting any kind of role to any account, which is contrary to system expectations as outline on the contest page

## Vulnerability Detail
The Contest page clearly shows the following:
![gmx_contest_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10962355/220352960-11ca8c18-a99c-40bd-b1e7-d2c54c65aebc.png)

- Only the Timelock contract should have the RoleAdmin role
- No EOA should have a Controller role

But through out the codebase there are no checks for the types of roles being granted, this means that in the following function TimeLockAdmin can grant any role to any account including his own. This include, TimeLockAdmin being able to:

- grant RoleAdmin to themselves or another EOA
- grant Controller role to themselves or another EOA

```solidity
    // @dev grant a role
    // @param account the account to grant the role
    // @param roleKey the role to grant
    function grantRoleAfterSignal(address account, bytes32 roleKey) external onlyTimelockAdmin nonReentrant {
        bytes32 actionKey = _grantRoleActionKey(account, roleKey);
        _validateAndClearAction(actionKey, "grantRoleAfterSignal");

        roleStore.grantRole(account, roleKey);

        EventUtils.EventLogData memory eventData;
        eventData.addressItems.initItems(1);
        eventData.addressItems.setItem(0, "account", account);
        eventData.bytes32Items.initItems(1);
        eventData.bytes32Items.setItem(0, "roleKey", roleKey);
        eventEmitter.emitEventLog1(
            "GrantRole",
            actionKey,
            eventData
        );
    }
```

```solidity
/**
     * @dev Grants the specified role to the given account.
     *
     * @param account The address of the account.
     * @param roleKey The key of the role to grant.
     */
    function grantRole(address account, bytes32 roleKey) external onlyRoleAdmin {
        _grantRole(account, roleKey);
    }

```

```solidity
function _grantRole(address account, bytes32 roleKey) internal {
        roles.add(roleKey);
        roleMembers[roleKey].add(account);
        roleCache[account][roleKey] = true;
    }

```
It can clearly be seen that from `grantRoleAfterSignal()` function, down to `_grantRole()` function, there is no explicit check as to which role is being granted to whom. This violates the contract and contest statement expectations.

## Impact
The Controller and RoleAdmin roles are very powerful roles, any account granted those roles can basically bypass any checks by the contract, including reentrancy guards and more. Therefore this vulnerability completely breaks the decentralization feature of the smart contract and puts the entire contracts at risk of being manipulated by a single entity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The role based access control should be modified to check what roles are being granted and by whom.
