# No Access Control on Who Can Call The ExchangeRouter.createWithdrawal() To Request Withdrawal

## Summary
No Check that the receiver address/caller of withdrawal has made deposit in the given market. And as such could lead to loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The ExchangeRouter.createWithdrawal() allows anyone to call it. Calling this function creates a withdrawal request which is then executed by the WithdrawalHandler.executeWithdrawal() function. While making this request, there is no check that the receiver address is a valid depositor in the given market.
## Impact
An attacker or malicious user can always call ExchangeRouter.createWithdrawal() and steal tokens once withdrawals have been executed.   
## Code Snippet
-https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics/blob/main/contracts/router/ExchangeRouter.sol#L142-L151
```solidity
    function createWithdrawal(
        WithdrawalUtils.CreateWithdrawalParams calldata params
    ) external payable nonReentrant returns (bytes32) {
        address account = msg.sender;

        return withdrawalHandler.createWithdrawal(
            account,
            params
        );
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a check for who can all this function. The withdrawal function should revert if a non-depositor of a given market calls the function.
