# Missing deadline check when perform swap

## Summary
Missing deadline check when perform swap operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
Missing deadline checks allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed in the future. You need to add a deadline parameter to all functions which potentially perform a swap on the user's behalf.

## Impact
Without deadline parameter, as a consequence, users can have their operations executed at unexpected times, when the market conditions are unfavorable.

You need to add deadline parameter in all swap functions.
