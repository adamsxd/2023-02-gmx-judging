# Gas amount that executor spends for order execution is does't count `withOraclePrices` modifier

## Summary
Gas amount that executor spends for order execution is does't count `withOraclePrices` modifier. Because of that order creator doesn't pay for `withOraclePrices` modifier execution, which is heavy.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user creates order, then he provides `executionFee` for the keeper, who will execute that order.
According to documentation, executors should be able to execute order for free.
https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics#fees

> Execution fees are also estimated and accounted for on creation of deposit, withdrawal, order requests so that keepers can execute transactions at a close to net zero cost.

Let's check, how `DepositHandler.executeDeposit` calculates amount of gas, that was spent with tx.

First thing, that we need to note, that `DepositHandler.executeDeposit` has [`withOraclePrices` modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L98).
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/OracleModule.sol#L30-L39
```solidity
    modifier withOraclePrices(
        Oracle oracle,
        DataStore dataStore,
        EventEmitter eventEmitter,
        OracleUtils.SetPricesParams memory params
    ) {
        oracle.setPrices(dataStore, eventEmitter, params);
        _;
        oracle.clearAllPrices();
    }
```
This modifier calls `oracle.setPrices` function first, which is [really big function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol#L211-L261) and consumes a lot of gas. Depending on the oracle info amount that is sent, gas amount can vary.

But function `DepositHandler.executeDeposit` [starts calculating gas consumption](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L100) already after `oracle.setPrices` function is executed. 
That means that when `GasUtils.payExecutionFee` function [will be called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L240-L247) in order to pay executor, then the function [will calculate used gas incorrectly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/gas/GasUtils.sol#L49).
## Impact
Executors should be able to execute order for free(should be fully compensated), but they are constantly underpaid.
Because of that, it will be not profitable for them, so they will stop executing orders and system will stop working.

## Recommendation
`withOraclePrices` gas should be accounted as well.
