# DecreaseOrderUtils.processOrder doesn't have slippage protection, when `order.swapPath().length == 0`

## Summary
DecreaseOrderUtils.processOrder doesn't have slippage protection, when `order.swapPath().length == 0`.
## Vulnerability Detail
When `DecreaseOrderUtils.processOrder` is called, then later in case if there is no `secondaryOutputAmount`, `result.outputToken` which is collateral token of position will be swapped according to `order.swapPath()` that was provided by user. In this case user can provide `order.minOutputAmount()` param which will take care of slippage.

In case if `order.swapPath().length == 0`, then `outputAmount` will be [sent directly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/DecreaseOrderUtils.sol#L76-L81) to user and user can't use slippage in this case.

Why this slippage is still needed for him? Because there are 2 places later in the code, where the swap is executed. First one [inside DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.processCollateral function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L144-L148), which [set 0 as  `minOutputAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L434).

Second one is [inside `DecreasePositionUtils.decreasePosition`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionUtils.sol#L281). And this function also [set 0 as  `minOutputAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L392).

Because the `minOutputAmount` is 0 in both cases, user who provides `order.swapPath().length == 0` doesn't have ability to use slippage protection later and can be frontrunned.
## Impact
When `order.swapPath().length == 0`, user doesn't have slippage protection

## Recommendation
Slippage should be checked even when `order.swapPath().length == 0`
