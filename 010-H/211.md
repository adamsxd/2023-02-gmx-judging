# slippage set to 0 it can cause users to get sandwiched

## Summary

If the user wants to decrease their position and want  to swap 10 eth to their collateral token but slippage is set to 0 so they will get a bad price and can lose alot of their eth

## Vulnerability Detail

ex:
bob has pos and loses 1 eth and is left with 10 eth they want to decrease the pos and get their collateral back in usdc they will have to swap with slippage set to 0 so they will lose funds
it's even worse the markets get the funds back they won't be able to pay out the full amount and they will be in dos state until the protocol is made whole

## Impact

no slippage check

## Code Snippet

```solidity

     try params.contracts.swapHandler.swap(
                SwapUtils.SwapParams(
                    params.contracts.dataStore,
                    params.contracts.eventEmitter,
                    params.contracts.oracle,
                    Bank(payable(params.market.marketToken)),
                    pnlToken, // tokenIn
                    profitAmount, // amountIn
                    swapPathMarkets, // markets
                    0, // minOutputAmount
                    params.market.marketToken, // receiver
                    false // shouldUnwrapNativeToken

```
