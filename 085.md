# `LatestRoundData` does not check for round completeness

## Summary
`latestRoundData` Does not check for round completeness, this will result in stale prices and return a wrong price. Functions that rely on values returned from the oracle will not have the most up to date prices, which can lead to a loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
 ```solidity
     // @dev set prices using external price feeds to save costs for tokens with stable prices
    // @param dataStore DataStore
    // @param eventEmitter EventEmitter
    // @param priceFeedTokens the tokens to set the prices using the price feeds for
    function _setPricesFromPriceFeeds(DataStore dataStore, EventEmitter eventEmitter, address[] memory priceFeedTokens) internal {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < priceFeedTokens.length; i++) {
            address token = priceFeedTokens[i];

            if (!primaryPrices[token].isEmpty()) {
                revert PriceAlreadySet(token, primaryPrices[token].min, primaryPrices[token].max);
            }

            IPriceFeed priceFeed = getPriceFeed(dataStore, token);

            (
                /* uint80 roundID */,
                int256 _price,
                /* uint256 startedAt */,
                /* uint256 timestamp */,
                /* uint80 answeredInRound */
            ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
 ```
 As we can see from the snippet above, the function `_setPricesFromPriceFeed`  calls to an oracle with the function `latestRoundData` there is not a check that validates round completeness. 
 
 The congestion of an oracle or the lack of maintenance could result in stale prices. In the past we have seen this issue lead to loss of fund for multiple protocols who do not implement oracles correctly. If we do not validate round completeness, we could in turn see stale prices and that will result in a loss of funds.
 
 This issue is similar to many found in sherlock audits in the past. Many times this issue is rated medium which i agree with. Below is a link to a similar bug.

## Impact
Let us assume there is congestion in chainlink, or nodes have abandoned the oracle. Anyone who uses this contract will not get the most up to date prices as the oracle has not set a new round. 

These stale prices could lead to loss of fund for either the protocol or the user. In a situation like the luna crash, not having the most up to date prices will do some serious damage and the loss of funds will be entirely the protocols fault.

GMX uses the oracle price feeds to supply prices for trade execution. Without the most up to date prices, users could either get a favorable price therefore hurting GMX. Or the user can get a price that is not favorable for them, causing a loss of funds for the user. Ultimately not being able to buy quick dip in the market because the price does not update in time will cause the user to no longer trust GMX additionally putting their reputation on the line.

in another example the user sees the price of an asset rise because of speculation. The user tries to trade but sees the price for trade is old an not current, therefore causing him to not be able to take advantage in a quick surge in prices, and ultimately causing loss of potential funds for the user. After something like this, the user is unlikely to remain with GMX.

## Recommendation
I recommend the protocol adds checks to validate round completeness.
