# Dividing before multiplication will lead to less fees being paid

## Summary

Dividing before multiplying in:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L948  will cause an incorrect accounting of the param `fundingUsd`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When calculating the  next getNextFundingAmountPerSize:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L912

It does calculate at some point of that function the `fundingUsd` amount:

cache.fundingUsd = (cache.sizeOfLargerSide / Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION) * cache.durationInSeconds * cache.fundingFactorPerSecond;


In solidity dividing before multiplying is a bad practice because the way it rounds the numbers.

In this case, if the param `cache.sizeOfLargerSide` is smaller than `FLOAT_PRECISION`, the funding USD result, will be 0. Due to rounding errors. The  `cache.sizeOfLargerSide` is derived from the open interest:

 cache.sizeOfLargerSide = cache.oi.longOpenInterest > cache.oi.shortOpenInterest ? cache.oi.longOpenInterest : cache.oi.shortOpenInterest;

Therefore for openInterests of less than 10**30, the `fundingUsd` param will be 0.

Not just that it will return 0 if the interest is less than 10**30, also the rounding errors of dividing before multiplying. Performing all the multiplications before will make the numerator number bigger, therefore the rounding that solidity has will not cause as much problems as dividing 2 similar numbers.


## Impact
Incorrect accounting of `fundingUsd` in different scenarios due to rounding errors from doing divisions before multiplications.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider always in Solidity multiply before any division

    cache.fundingUsd = (cache.sizeOfLargerSide  * cache.durationInSeconds * cache.fundingFactorPerSecond) 
    /Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION;
