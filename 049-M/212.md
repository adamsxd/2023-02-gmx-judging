# [M-01] Incorrect refund of execution fee to user

## Summary
During execution of Deposits, Withdrawals and Orders, users are refunded part of the `executionFee` after accounting for `gasUsed` during the transaction. In the codebase, an incorrect value of `startingGas` is used to calculate the `gasUsed`, resulting in users getting less than what they should be refunded. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Vulnerability exists in DepositHandler.sol, WithdrawalHandler.sol and OrderHandler.sol. Using DepositHandler.sol as an example:

((1) In [line 94](https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics/blob/b1557fa286c35f54c65a38a7b57baf87ecad1b5b/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L94) of DepositHandler.sol, Order Keepers call `executeDeposit()` and `startingGas` is forwarded to an external call `_executeDeposit`. 
(2) In ExecuteDepositUtils.sol, `_executeDeposit` further calls `GasUtils.payExecutionFee(... params.startingGas`. 
(3) Then in GasUtils.sol, `payExecutionFee()` calculates `gasUsed = startingGas - gasleft();` 
(4) `gasUsed` is used to calculate `executionFeeForKeeper`, and after paying the fee to keeper, the remainder of `executionFee` (previously paid by user) is refunded to the user

The issue lies with (1) where `startingGas` is passed into `_executeDeposit` and assumed to be all remaining gas left. [EIP-150](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-150) defines the "all but one 64th" rule, which states that always at least 1/64 of the gas still not used for this transaction cannot be sent along. Therefore, in (3) `gasUsed` is overstated by 1/64 and the refund back to user in (4) is incorrect (less than what user should get back). 

**Proof of Concept**

In the test above, it is demonstrated that external function calls are forwarded with only 63/64 of the remaining gas. A separate internal function call used to demonstrate the difference in gas costs.  

## Impact
GMX Users will receive an incorrect refund from the execution fee and will be overpaying for deposit, withdraw and order executions.

## Recommendation

In DepositHandler.sol, for `executeDeposit` it is recommended that `startingGas()` is calculated **after** the external call is made.

Alternatively, in GasUtils.sol, gasUsed could be computed with 63/64 of startingGas, in order to obtain the correct refund amount to the user. This would also apply to Withdraw and Order executions which have similar code flows.
