# Possible Dos when creating a withdrawal, because recorded token transfer into the contract may be incorrect

## Summary
wnt is an ERC20 non-compliant token but IERC20's 'balanceOf' was used to retrieve it's current balance held by the contract in function _recordTransferIn() found in StrictBank.sol
```solidity
        uint256 nextBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
```

Also there's this 'If statement' checking if the value of wntAmount is less than the value of a parameter called executionFee. If it is, the contract will revert with an error message indicating that the WNT amount is insufficient to cover the execution fee.
```solidity
        if (wntAmount < params.executionFee) {
            revert InsufficientWntAmount(wntAmount, params.executionFee);
        }
```
## Vulnerability Detail
wnt is an ERC20 non-compliant token therefore calling 'IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this))' will result in an error.
The balanceOf() function expects the token to have a balanceOf() function that returns the balance of a particular address.
 As the token does not have this function, then calling 'IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this))' will fail.

you'll see this in _recordTransferIn() in StrictBank.sol
```solidity
    function _recordTransferIn(address token) internal returns (uint256) {
        uint256 prevBalance = tokenBalances[token];
        uint256 nextBalance = "IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));"
        tokenBalances[token] = nextBalance;


        return nextBalance - prevBalance;
    }
```
Token balance will be unassigned here -  'tokenBalances[token] = nextBalance;', because 'nextBalance' will be unassigned too, and that's because 'IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));' will fail.

Now the if statement 
```solidity
        if (wntAmount < params.executionFee) {
            revert InsufficientWntAmount(wntAmount, params.executionFee);
        }
``` 
**will likely result in a runtime error**, **because 'wntAmount' will be unassigned and undefined.**

## Impact
The internal function _recordTransferIn() which is called by the external function recordTransferIn() in StrictBank.sol won't be able to retrieve the current balance of wnt held by the contract, because
```solidity
   uint256 nextBalance = **'IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));'**
```
the above line of code will fail.

And StrictBank.sol's external function recordTransferIn() is being used by WithdrawalUtils.sol's createWithdrawal() function to record the token transfer into the contract.
Now 'wntAmount' stores the faulty result of the recorded token transfer into the contract(remember _recordTransferIn() failed to retrieve the current balance of wnt held by the contract), and 'wntAmount' is now being used in an if statement to check and make sure that there's a **revert**  when it's value is less than the 'executionFee'. 
Now runtime errors will arise and there will be a revert because 'wntAmount' will be unassigned and undefined because **'IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));'** failed
```solidity
        if (wntAmount < params.executionFee) {
            revert InsufficientWntAmount(wntAmount, params.executionFee);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make 'wnt' an ERC20 compliant token to be able to use IERC20's balanceOf and other ERC20 compliant specific functions.
