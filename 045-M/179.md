# Liquidation shouldn't be used to close positions that were fully-collateralized prior to collateral requirement changes

## Summary

There are various factors associated with minimum collateral requirements, and if a position falls below them, the position is liquidated.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the position was over-collateralized and in profit prior to the change in the minimums, and the minimum is increased, the position is liquidated.


## Impact

Liquidation gives all funds to the pool, giving nothing back to the user


## Code Snippet

A position becomes liquidatable once it falls below the [changeable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/config/Config.sol#L231-L233) collateral requirements:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/PositionUtils.sol : PositionUtils.isPositionLiquidatable()   #1

377            if (shouldValidateMinCollateralUsd) {
378 @>             cache.minCollateralUsd = dataStore.getUint(Keys.MIN_COLLATERAL_USD).toInt256();
379                if (cache.remainingCollateralUsd < cache.minCollateralUsd) {
380                    return true;
381                }
382            }
383    
384            if (cache.remainingCollateralUsd <= 0) {
385                return true;
386            }
387    
388:           // validate if (remaining collateral) / position.size is less than the min collateral factor (max leverage exceeded)
```

Liquidations give [everything](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol#L347-L358) to the pool, and nothing to the position's account


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Close the position with a market order, rather than liquidating it, if the user was previously above the minimum with the old factor
