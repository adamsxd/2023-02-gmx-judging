# Arbitrary Code Execution via withdrawAndSendNativeToken() function in _transferOutNativeToken() function

## Summary
the `_transferOutNativeToken()` function of the Bank contract using `withdrawAndSendNativeToken()` function is concerning, as it can be used to execute arbitrary code, and it will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code causing significant harm to the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
`TokenUtils.withdrawAndSendNativeToken()` function is intended to transfer native tokens to a designated receiver, but if an attacker can control the `receiver` address, they could use this function to execute arbitrary code, this is because the function allows any code that the attacker can deploy to the supplied `receiver` address to be executed.

An attacker could create a smart contract and deploy it to the `receiver address`, then, when the `_transferOutNativeToken()` function is called with this malicious `receiver` address, the attacker's code would be executed, giving them control over the smart contract.

Steps:
1. Attacker gains control of the `dataStore` variable in the Bank contract.
2. The attacker calls the `_transferOutNativeToken()` function and passes in a malicious value for the token parameter.
3. The `withdrawAndSendNativeToken()` function is executed, which may allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
4. 
## Impact
It could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, which could let them steal funds or have other adverse effects on the system. If exploited, this vulnerability could cause significant damage to the bank system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Update the `_transferOutNativeToken()` function to remove the use of the `withdrawAndSendNativeToken()` function.

2. Use a safe alternative function for transferring the native token, such as `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`.
