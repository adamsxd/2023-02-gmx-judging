# Malicious early user can manipulate the price of market token to take an unfair share of future user deposits

## Summary
A well known attack vector for almost all shares based liquidity pool contracts, where an early user can manipulate the price per share and profit from late users' deposits because of the precision loss caused by the rather large value of price per share.
## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious early user can deposit with 1 wei of asset token as the first depositor of the market token, and get 1 wei of token.

Then the attacker can send 10000e18 - 1 of market tokens and inflate the price per share from 1.0000 to an extreme value of 1.0000e22 ( from (1 + 10000e18 - 1) / 1) .

As a result, the future user who deposits 19999e18 will only receive 1 wei (from 19999e18 * 1 / 10000e18) of market token.

They will immediately lose 9999e18 or half of their deposits if they redeem right after the deposit.
## Impact
The attacker can profit from future users' deposits. While the late users will lose part of their funds to the attacker.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
  // calculate the usd amount using positiveImpactAmount since it may
            // be capped by the max available amount in the impact pool
            mintAmount += MarketUtils.usdToMarketTokenAmount(
                positiveImpactAmount.toUint256() * _params.tokenOutPrice.min,
                poolValue,
                supply
            );
```

the snippet above calls into the function `MarketUtils.usdToMarketTokenAmount` which is shown below

```solidity
   // @dev convert a USD value to number of market tokens
    // @param usdValue the input USD value
    // @param poolValue the value of the pool
    // @param supply the supply of market tokens
    // @return the number of market tokens
    function usdToMarketTokenAmount(
        uint256 usdValue,
        uint256 poolValue,
        uint256 supply
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (supply == 0 || poolValue == 0) {
            return Precision.floatToWei(usdValue);
        }

        // round market tokens down
        return supply * usdValue / poolValue;
    }
```

If we take a look at the logic above we can confirm that the vulnerability explained above is valid.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider requiring the first minter to mint a minimum amount of tokens to make the pool more resistant to manipulation.
