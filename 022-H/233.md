# while creating deposit, fee can be deducted in wrong manner if initialToken is not final token

## Summary

while creating deposit, fee can be deducted in wrong manner if initialToken is not final token

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity

        if (market.longToken == wnt) {
            initialLongTokenAmount -= params.executionFee;
        } else if (market.shortToken == wnt) {
            initialShortTokenAmount -= params.executionFee;
```

here, there is implied assumption that `longToken`  == `initialLongTokenAmount` which is not always true, they might be completly different tokens and have different decimals

## Impact

wrong amount of execution fee deducted
