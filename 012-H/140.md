# Limit orders are broken when there are price gaps

## Summary

Limit orders fail to execute when the price becomes worse for the order in the block after the order is submitted.


## Vulnerability Detail

Limit orders require that all oracle-provided prices come from blocks [_after_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/DecreaseOrderUtils.sol#L134-L156) the order has been submitted. In addition, limit orders's primary and secondary prices are required to straddle the trigger price.

## Impact

If the primary/secondary prices go well past the trigger price (e.g. due to a price gap), then the order execution will revert, leaving the user exposed to their position, even if they had a valid stoploss set.


## Code Snippet

Limit orders require prices to straddle the trigger price, and revert if they don't:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/BaseOrderUtils.sol : BaseOrderUtils.setExactOrderPrice()   #1

238            if (orderType == Order.OrderType.LimitIncrease ||
239                orderType == Order.OrderType.LimitDecrease ||
240                orderType == Order.OrderType.StopLossDecrease
241            ) {
242                uint256 primaryPrice = oracle.getPrimaryPrice(indexToken).pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice);
243                uint256 secondaryPrice = oracle.getSecondaryPrice(indexToken).pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice);
244    
...
258                if (shouldValidateAscendingPrice) {
259                    // check that the earlier price (primaryPrice) is smaller than the triggerPrice
260                    // and that the later price (secondaryPrice) is larger than the triggerPrice
261 @>                 bool ok = primaryPrice <= triggerPrice && triggerPrice <= secondaryPrice;
262                    if (!ok) {
263                        revert InvalidOrderPrices(primaryPrice, secondaryPrice, triggerPrice, shouldValidateAscendingPrice);
264                    }
...
270                } else {
271                    // check that the earlier price (primaryPrice) is larger than the triggerPrice
272                    // and that the later price (secondaryPrice) is smaller than the triggerPrice
273 @>                 bool ok = primaryPrice >= triggerPrice && triggerPrice >= secondaryPrice;
274                    if (!ok) {
275                        revert InvalidOrderPrices(primaryPrice, secondaryPrice, triggerPrice, shouldValidateAscendingPrice);
276                    }
...
282:               }

## Recommendation

Don't [revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol#L253) if both the primary and secondary prices are worse than the trigger price. Use the trigger price as the execution price.
