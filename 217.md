# ERC20 transfer zero amount can be reverted

## Summary
In [Router.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/Router.sol#L26-L28) we have `pluginTransfer()`. This function transfer the specified amount of tokens from the account to the receiver.

Certain ERC20 tokens do not support zero-value token transfers and revert.
As ERC20 can be an arbitrary token, in the case when such token doesn't allow for zero amount transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail

In addition to the code snippet below, you should also check the other places where there is a ERC20 transfer.

## Impact

ERC20 transfer zero amount can be reverted.

## Code Snippet
[Router.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/router/Router.sol#L26-L28)
```solidity
26: function pluginTransfer(address token, address account, address receiver, uint256 amount) external onlyRouterPlugin {
27:        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(account, receiver, amount); 
28:    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a simple check for zero-value token transfers.
