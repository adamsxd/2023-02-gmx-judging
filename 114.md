# Keeper can drain funds by creating deposits/withdrawals and executing them

## Summary

Keepers can drain the `depositVault` and `withdrawalVault` by being both the user and the keeper.
Consider the following scenario:

1. Keeper creates a deposit
	1. Pay execution fee
2. Keeper executes the deposit
	1. Keeper gets incentive reward + execution fee
3. Keeper create withdrawal
	1. Pay execution fee
4. Keeper executes withdrawal
	1. Keeper gets incentive reward + execution fee
	2. keeper funds are back 

The above can be done until the vaults are drained. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In order to incentivize keepers to execution deposits/withdrawals/orders, there is a multiplier factor to each execution.

The amount rewarded is a function of gas used and the multiplier factor.

```solidity
function payExecutionFee(
        DataStore dataStore,
        StrictBank bank,
        uint256 executionFee,
        uint256 startingGas,
        address keeper,
        address user
    ) external {
        uint256 gasUsed = startingGas - gasleft();
        uint256 executionFeeForKeeper = adjustGasUsage(dataStore, gasUsed) * tx.gasprice;

-----------

function adjustGasUsage(DataStore dataStore, uint256 gasUsed) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 baseGasLimit = dataStore.getUint(Keys.EXECUTION_GAS_FEE_BASE_AMOUNT);
        uint256 multiplierFactor = dataStore.getUint(Keys.EXECUTION_GAS_FEE_MULTIPLIER_FACTOR);
        uint256 gasLimit = baseGasLimit + Precision.applyFactor(gasUsed, multiplierFactor);
        return gasLimit;
    }
```

When the `EXECUTION_GAS_FEE_MULTIPLIER_FACTOR` is big enough to result in an `executionFeeForKeeper` that will  be profitable to the keeper to deposit/withdraw and execute them - The keeper can continue to do so until the `depositVault` and `withdrawalVault` are drained

## Recommendation

Consider splitting the keepers rewards to shares of the total keeper network. In such a way, keepers will not be able to earn more rewards then other keepers and will not drain the vaults.
A keeper will only be able to earn their slice
