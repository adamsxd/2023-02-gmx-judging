# Due to lack of a transfer logic, long/short tokens could not be deposited into the Bank when the DepositHandler#`executeDeposit()`  would be called

## Summary
Due to lack of a transfer logic, long/short tokens could not be deposited into the Bank at the end of transaction when the DepositHandler#`executeDeposit()`  would be called.

## Vulnerability Detail
The amount of  long/short tokens would be deposited into the Bank via the DepositHandler#`executeDeposit()`.

Also, within the DepositHandler#`executeDeposit()`, the DepositHandler#`_executeDeposit()` would be internally called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L102-L107
```solidity
    function executeDeposit(
        bytes32 key,
        OracleUtils.SetPricesParams calldata oracleParams
    ) external
        globalNonReentrant
        onlyOrderKeeper
        withOraclePrices(oracle, dataStore, eventEmitter, oracleParams)
    {
        ...
        try this._executeDeposit( /// @audit
            key,
            oracleParams,
            msg.sender,
            startingGas
        ) {
        ...
```

Within the DepositHandler#`_executeDeposit()`, the ExecuteDepositUtils#`executeDeposit()` would be internally called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L174
```solidity
    function _executeDeposit(
        bytes32 key,
        OracleUtils.SetPricesParams memory oracleParams,
        address keeper,
        uint256 startingGas
    ) external onlySelf {
        ...

        ExecuteDepositUtils.executeDeposit(params);  /// @audit
        ...
```



According to the [README of the gmx-synthetics repo](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-masaun/tree/master/gmx-synthetics#markets), 
> _Liquidity providers can deposit either the long or short collateral token or both to mint liquidity tokens._
> _The long collateral token is used to back long positions, while the short collateral token is used to back short positions._

Also, according to [the protocol design](https://github.com/masaun/bug-bounty_records/issues/96#issuecomment-1467216442), amount of the **long tokens** and amount of the **short tokens** are supposed to be deposited into the Market (market pool).
  
However, within the deposit functions above (the DepositHandler#`executeDeposit()` and the DepositHandler#`_executeDeposit()` and the ExecuteDepositUtils#`executeDeposit()`), there is no transfer logic that the long/short tokens would be transferred from a user (`msg.sender`) to the DepositHandler contract.

As a result, even if the DepositHandler#`executeDeposit()`  would be called, long/short tokens could not be deposited into the Bank at the end of transaction. 

## Impact
Even if the DepositHandler#`executeDeposit()`  would be called, long/short tokens could not be deposited into from a user (`msg.sender`) the Bank at the end of transaction.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a transfer logic to the DepositHandler#`executeDeposit()` in order for a user (`msg.sender`) to transfer the long/short tokens into the DepositHandler contract.
