# `setLatestAdlBlock` may set the wrong block number

## Summary

The whole codebase is written to use `currentBlockNumber` to ensure that the blocks on Arbitrum are properly accounted for.
However `UpdateAdlState` doesn't use `currentBlockNumber` and instead uses `block.number` which may not match with the block number on arbitrum

## Vulnerability Detail

The discrepancy may cause the Adl functionality to not work as intended

## Impact

Because `UpdateAdlState` uses `block.number` instead of `currentBlockNumber()` the adl functionality may work in unintended ways

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace

```solidity
        setLatestAdlBlock(dataStore, market, isLong, block.number);
```

With

```solidity
        setLatestAdlBlock(dataStore, market, isLong, currentBlockNumber());
```
