# Incorrect usage of block number

## Summary
protocol does not use the correct block number. This leads to functions that rely on block number being incorrect, failing or not executing as they should.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol does not ensure that the block numbers ,used in various functions, are consistent throughout the code base. Below i will demonstrate how the protocol uses the L1 `block.number` when it truly intends to use the L2 `block.number`. This bug only affects deployment on the Arbitrum chain.

AdlUtils.sol
```solidity
    // @param maxOracleBlockNumbers the oracle block numbers for the prices stored in the oracle
    function updateAdlState(
        DataStore dataStore,
        EventEmitter eventEmitter,
        Oracle oracle,
        address market,
        bool isLong,
        uint256[] memory maxOracleBlockNumbers
    ) external {
        uint256 latestAdlBlock = getLatestAdlBlock(dataStore, market, isLong);

        if (!maxOracleBlockNumbers.areGreaterThanOrEqualTo(latestAdlBlock)) {
            OracleUtils.revertOracleBlockNumbersAreSmallerThanRequired(maxOracleBlockNumbers, latestAdlBlock);
        }

        Market.Props memory _market = MarketUtils.getEnabledMarket(dataStore, market);
        MarketUtils.MarketPrices memory prices = MarketUtils.getMarketPrices(oracle, _market);
        (bool shouldEnableAdl, int256 pnlToPoolFactor, uint256 maxPnlFactor) = MarketUtils.isPnlFactorExceeded(
            dataStore,
            _market,
            prices,
            isLong,
            Keys.MAX_PNL_FACTOR
        );

        setIsAdlEnabled(dataStore, market, isLong, shouldEnableAdl);
        setLatestAdlBlock(dataStore, market, isLong, block.number);

        emitAdlStateUpdated(eventEmitter, market, isLong, pnlToPoolFactor, maxPnlFactor, shouldEnableAdl);
    }
```
In the Snippet above we should focus on the `setLatestAdlBlock()` function. As we can see the function here uses block.number.

Chain.sol
```solidity
  // @dev return the current block's number
    // @return the current block's number
    function currentBlockNumber() internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (block.chainid == ARBITRUM_CHAIN_ID || block.chainid == ARBITRUM_RINKEBY_CHAIN_ID) {
            return arbSys.arbBlockNumber();
        }

        return block.number;
    }
```
However in this snippet of code we can see that if the chain is arbitrum, we will not have the same block numbers as the previous snippet.

let me explain why this is a problem.

The protocol uses something called 'ADL' or auto-deleverage. Essentially what this is for is to lower the leverage when it has passed a certain threshold. This is explained in comments in the snippet below.
```solidity
 // @dev Multiple positions may need to be reduced to ensure that the pending
    // profits does not exceed the allowed thresholds
    //
    // This automatic reduction of positions can only be done if the pool is in a state
    // where auto-deleveraging is required
    //
    // This function checks the pending profit state and updates an isAdlEnabled
    // flag to avoid having to repeatedly validate whether auto-deleveraging is required
    //
    // Once the pending profit has been reduced below the threshold this function can
    // be called again to clear the flag
    //
    // The ADL check would be possible to do in AdlHandler.executeAdl as well
    // but with that order keepers could use stale oracle prices to prove that
    // an ADL state is possible
    //
    // Having this function allows any order keeper to disable ADL if prices
    // have updated such that ADL is no longer needed
    //
    // @param dataStore DataStore
    // @param eventEmitter EventEmitter
    // @param oracle Oracle
    // @param market address of the market to check
    // @param isLong indicates whether to check the long or short side of the market
    // @param maxOracleBlockNumbers the oracle block numbers for the prices stored in the oracle
    function updateAdlState(
        DataStore dataStore,
        EventEmitter eventEmitter,
        Oracle oracle,
        address market,
        bool isLong,
        uint256[] memory maxOracleBlockNumbers
    ) external {
       
    }
```
Let us assume we are on the arbitrum chain and the protocol wants to use the L2 block.number instead of the L1 block.number.
```solidity
    SetPricesCache memory cache;
        cache.minBlockConfirmations = dataStore.getUint(Keys.MIN_ORACLE_BLOCK_CONFIRMATIONS);
        cache.maxPriceAge = dataStore.getUint(Keys.MAX_ORACLE_PRICE_AGE);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < params.tokens.length; i++) {
            cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber = OracleUtils.getUncompactedOracleBlockNumber(params.compactedMinOracleBlockNumbers, i);
            cache.info.maxOracleBlockNumber = OracleUtils.getUncompactedOracleBlockNumber(params.compactedMaxOracleBlockNumbers, i);

            if (cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber > cache.info.maxOracleBlockNumber) {
                revert InvalidMinMaxBlockNumber(cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber, cache.info.maxOracleBlockNumber);
            }

            cache.info.oracleTimestamp = OracleUtils.getUncompactedOracleTimestamp(params.compactedOracleTimestamps, i);

            if (cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber > Chain.currentBlockNumber()) {
                revert InvalidBlockNumber(cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber);
            }

            if (cache.info.oracleTimestamp + cache.maxPriceAge < Chain.currentTimestamp()) {
                revert MaxPriceAgeExceeded(cache.info.oracleTimestamp);
            }

            // block numbers must be in ascending order
            if (cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber < cache.prevMinOracleBlockNumber) {
                revert BlockNumbersNotSorted(cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber, cache.prevMinOracleBlockNumber);
            }
            cache.prevMinOracleBlockNumber = cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber;

            cache.info.blockHash = bytes32(0);
            if (Chain.currentBlockNumber() - cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber <= cache.minBlockConfirmations) {
                cache.info.blockHash = Chain.getBlockHash(cache.info.minOracleBlockNumber);
            }
```
Note the function calls Chain.currentBlockNumber()
```solidity
// @dev return the current block's number
    // @return the current block's number
    function currentBlockNumber() internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (block.chainid == ARBITRUM_CHAIN_ID || block.chainid == ARBITRUM_RINKEBY_CHAIN_ID) {
            return arbSys.arbBlockNumber();
        }

        return block.number;
    }
```
As we can see, if the block.chainId is arbitrum, the L2 block number is used. We can make sure this is true by taking a look at this line of code
```solidity
// @dev Globally available variables for Arbitrum may have both an L1 and an L2
// value, the ArbSys interface is used to retrieve the L2 value
interface ArbSys {
    function arbBlockNumber() external view returns (uint256);
    function arbBlockHash(uint256 blockNumber) external view returns (bytes32);
}
```

Now we can look back at this function that sets ADL and take block.number as a param.
```solidity
setLatestAdlBlock(dataStore, market, isLong, block.number);
```
When in arbitrum, the block numbers used will be incorrect. This is a problem because `setLatestAdlBlock` function will not work as intended. 

To show that block.number and arbBlockNumber() can deviate very frequently, i have deployed a smart contract on arbitrum that showcases this. I will link that below.
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7c5a96b3a56ac2c8a57dbf9a4edf11a4e999c9f7#readContract

This further affects how ADL work in the protocol and would lead to in not working entirely. 
This is a big problem because ADL manages the leverage when threshold is too high as we saw earlier in this issue. If we cannot use ADL the threshold will be exceeded and this leads to higher than normal risk, and PNL.
## Impact
The impact here is since functions that set ADL rely on an accurate block.number and the protocol implementation of block.number is incorrectly used. Those functions will fail

Since functions fail, ADL is never set and therefore the protocol cannot auto deleverage. This becomes a huge problem when leverage greatly exceeds the leverage threshold. This will in turn cause higher than expected volatility in the protocol.

With higher than expected volatility, The protocol may unfairly liquidate positions of its users. This is a Direct loss of funds for the user when the user should have never suffered such liquidation. Users will lose trust in the protocol

## Recommendation
I recommend the protocol fixes this issue by ensuring the correct block.number is used where it should be used.
