# Chainlink oracle can return stale prices

## Summary
In `_setPricesFromPriceFeeds`, `latestRoundData` is used to fetch prices from Chainlink. However, the result is not validated and stale data can be returned.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_setPricesFromPriceFeeds`, notice that `roundID`, `timestamp` and `answeredInRound` are commented and unused. The only validation done is to check that price is more than 0. Stale data can be returned from Chainlink and used.

```solidity
            IPriceFeed priceFeed = getPriceFeed(dataStore, token);


            (
                /* uint80 roundID */,
                int256 _price,
                /* uint256 startedAt */,
                /* uint256 timestamp */,
                /* uint80 answeredInRound */
            ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();


            uint256 price = SafeCast.toUint256(_price);
            uint256 precision = getPriceFeedMultiplier(dataStore, token);


            price = price * precision / Precision.FLOAT_PRECISION;


            if (price == 0) {
                revert EmptyFeedPrice(token);
            }
```
## Impact

## Recommendation

Recommend checking for stale prices

```solidity
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "stale price");
require(timestamp > 0, "round has not completed");
```
