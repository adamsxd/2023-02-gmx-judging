# Price impact is not calculated for initial market when withdrawing

## Summary
Price impact is not calculated for initial market when withdrawing
## Vulnerability Detail
When user deposits some initialShortToken and initialLongToken, then this tokens are going to [be swapped](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L129-L145) to the market long/short tokens, were user wants to mint LP tokens.
Along the swaps, for each swap [price impact is calculated and accrued](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/swap/SwapUtils.sol#L184-L238). After that, when initial tokens are swapped to market.longToken/shortToken, impact price [is calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L179-L190) and [accrued](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L297-L348) for the market, were LP will be minted.

But when user withdraws, then price impact for current market [is not calculated and not accrued](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/withdrawal/WithdrawalUtils.sol#L261-L391). But price impact will be calculated during the swap from market.longToken/shortToken to the output tokens. 

This is incorrect. For example if user will initiate withdraw without exchanging market.LongToken/shortToken to another tokens, then no price impact will be calculated at all.
## Impact
Price impact is not calculated and accrued for withdrawal market. Increase risk of price manipulation.

## Recommendation
You need to calculate price impact of withdrawing for initial market.
