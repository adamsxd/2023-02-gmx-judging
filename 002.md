# `indexed` keyword for `string` type variables in events may lead to data loss

## Summary
```indexed``` keyword for reference type variables such as ```string``` returns the keccak256 hash of the ```string```.

## Vulnerability Detail
when the ```indexed``` keyword is used for reference typed variables such as ```string```, it will return the hash of the mentioned string.
Thus, the event which is supposed to inform all of the applications subscribed to its emitting transaction (e.g. front-end of the DApp, or the backend listeners to that event), would get a meaningless and obscure 32 bytes that correspond to keccak256 of an encoded string. This may cause some problems on the DApp side and even may lead to data loss.
For more information about the indexed events, one can check here(https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html?highlight=indexed#events).

## Impact
All the applications which subscribe to a transaction in which an event is emitted will get a 32-byte length keccak256 hash. This hash would be obscure as its original string is underivable. Thus, this may lead to data loss and prevent the front end to be updated.
Consider this scenario as an example:
1 - When an order is created, an event is emitted to inform the DApp to update itself.
2 - Inside the function ```emitOrderCreated()``` we expect to see the state "OrderCreated":

3 - But as the string is defined as ```indexed``` we'll get an obscure 32-byte hash and listeners will not be notified properly.

## Recommendation
Consider removing the word ```indexed``` inside the events for ```string``` type variables.
