# Receiver can be an malicious and gain free profit and not get liquidated/adling

## Summary

If the receiver is smart contract and protocol is going to send eth on the `.call` we specify large gas revert by having a big `bytes memory data` and the keeper will not make the tx and when the price is right they can change it and make the call execute getting free profit

## Vulnerability Detail

even though the `bytes memory data` is commented out the high-level solidity call still receives the bytes so an attacker can craft a huge string of data that gas will be too much for the keepers to process and the tx will sit until tx won't revert.

## Impact

An attacker can cause this to gain free profits like when they have a long position on eth and the price of eth is falling they can make the tx revert but when the price of eth is high they can make the tx go through and they won't even get liquidated because the keeper cant liquidate them or adl them. This attack only works on `shouldUnwrapNativeToken=true`
if the protocol cant liquidate or position that is really bad and that can cause bad debt and if they cant adl that will also cause bad debt and profit for the attacker

## Code Snippet

when decreasing order/ or liquidating the position or adling  it will revert and not work  

```solidity


        if (order.swapPath().length == 0) {
            MarketToken(payable(order.market())).transferOut(
                result.outputToken,
                order.receiver(),
                result.outputAmount,
                order.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()

```

we can do the same thing for swapping and wait until eth is at good price

```solidity

        SwapUtils.swap(SwapUtils.SwapParams(
            params.contracts.dataStore,
            params.contracts.eventEmitter,
            params.contracts.oracle,
            params.contracts.orderVault,
            params.order.initialCollateralToken(),
            params.order.initialCollateralDeltaAmount(),
            params.swapPathMarkets,
            params.order.minOutputAmount(),
            params.order.receiver(),
            params.order.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()
        ));

```
