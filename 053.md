# Excess amount sent by user is taken by protocol

## Summary
Excess amount sent by user is taken by protocol. That value is not used to mint additional tokens for depositor, not returned and also not paid back when deposit is canceled.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user deposits he should pay fee for execution of order. This fee is paid in native token. In case if short/long token is not native token then `GasUtils.handleExcessExecutionFee` function [is called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/DepositUtils.sol#L87-L92).

This function will simply send overpaid amount to [`Keys.HOLDING_ACCOUNT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/gas/GasUtils.sol#L102-L106). At this time overpaid funds for user are lost as they will never be returned and also they will not be used as additional amount to increase `executionFee` in case if fee is changed.

Also in case if user will cancel his deposit, then only `executionFee` amount will be [returned back to depositor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/DepositUtils.sol#L189), however whole amount that was sent should be returned back.
## Impact
User loses overpaid funds

## Recommendation
Actually i don't see the reason why protocol takes that overpaid amount. And i am sure that at least when deposit is canceled, than that overpaid amount should be returned to depositor.
