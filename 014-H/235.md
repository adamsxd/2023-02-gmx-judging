# faulty abi decoding from revert in catch block can lead to attacker controlled execution

## Summary

faulty abi decoding from revert in catch block can lead to attacker controlled execution

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        (string memory reason, /* bool hasRevertMessage */) = ErrorUtils.getRevertMessage(reasonBytes);
```
attacker can return faulty abi encoded message from call such that it fails while decoding and hence allowing attacker to control when deposit is executed

## Impact

due to this, attacker do risk-free deposit when market conditions are favourable

## Recommendation

do not decode the reason
