# latestRoundData() has no check for round completeness

## Summary
No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated prices. The functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected and sometimes can lead to funding loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
Although the external oracle may or may not be the chainlink oracle, as pricing retrieval implements the same latestRoundData interface as the Chainlink oracle, I assume that we should add more validation that is suggested in Chainlink's documentation.

_setPricesFromPriceFeeds calls out to an oracle with latestRoundData() to get the price of some token. Although the returned timestamp is checked, there is no check for round completeness.

Reference
Chainlink documentation:
https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds

## Impact
If there is a problem with the oracle starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

This could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated prices.

As a result, the functions relying on accurate price feed might not work as expected, which sometimes can lead to funding loss.

## Recommendation
Change the following code
 ```solidity
             (
       (
                /* uint80 roundID */,
                int256 _price,
                /* uint256 startedAt */,
                /* uint256 timestamp */,
                /* uint80 answeredInRound */
            ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```
             
to             
             
```solidity
        (
                uint80 roundID,
                int256 _price,
                /* uint256 startedAt */,
                /* uint256 timestamp */,
                uint80 answeredInRound,
            ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

            require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");
```
