# Trades in blocks where the bid or ask drops to zero will be priced using the previous block's price

## Summary

The oracle prices used for traces allow multiple oracles and their last prices to be provided. The oldest block's price becomes the primary price, and the newer price becomes the secondary price. Trades in blocks where the primary price is non-zero, but the secondary price is zero, will be priced incorrectly


## Vulnerability Detail

For position [increase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/IncreasePositionUtils.sol#L61)/[decrease](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionUtils.sol#L73) orders, the price used is either the primary or the secondary price, but a value of zero for the secondary price is considered to be a sentinel value indicating ['empty'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/price/Price.sol#L18-L20
), or 'no price has been set'. In such cases, the secondary price is ignored, and the primary price is used instead.


## Impact

Users exiting their positions in the first block where the price touches zero, are able to exit their positions at the primary (older) price rather than the secondary (newer) price of zero. This is pricing difference is at the expense of the pool and the other side of the trade.


## Code Snippet

The secondary price is only used when it's [non-zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/price/Price.sol#L18-L20):
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol : Oracle.getLatestPrice()   #1

341        function getLatestPrice(address token) external view returns (Price.Props memory) {
342            if (token == address(0)) { return Price.Props(0, 0); }
343    
344            Price.Props memory secondaryPrice = secondaryPrices[token];
345    
346 @>         if (!secondaryPrice.isEmpty()) {
347                return secondaryPrice;
348            }
349    
350            Price.Props memory primaryPrice = primaryPrices[token];
351            if (!primaryPrice.isEmpty()) {
352                return primaryPrice;
353            }
354    
355            revert OracleUtils.EmptyLatestPrice(token);
356:       }
```

Note that even if just the bid touches zero, that's enough to disqualify the secondary price.


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Use an actual sentinel flag rather than overloading the meaning of a 'zero' price.
