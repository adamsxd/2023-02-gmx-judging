# callback receiver can control when to allow order execution

## Summary

callback receiver can control when to allow order execution

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        uint256 marketTokensBalance = MarketToken(payable(withdrawal.market())).balanceOf(withdrawal.account());
        if (marketTokensBalance < withdrawal.marketTokenAmount()) {
            revert InsufficientMarketTokens(marketTokensBalance, withdrawal.marketTokenAmount());
        }
```     
this allow attackers to have control over when it will not be reverted, attacker will increase upto required balance to and delay withdrawal to benifit from fees or market movement until that 

## Impact

unintended access control for when to allow withdrawal

Manual Review

## Recommendation

do not use balanceOf checks, instead revert and consume all gas on failed transfer
