# validateReserve fails to validate minium reserve, as a result, a bank run cannot be prevented.

## Summary
``validateReserve()`` fails to validate minimum reserve, as a result, a bank run cannot be prevented. 

## Vulnerability Detail
We show how ``validateReserve()`` fails to validate the assurance of the minimum reserve.

1) The ``validateReserve()`` function attempts to validate that the minimum reserve is ensured. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1150-L1172](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1150-L1172)

2) However, the following line checks the wrong condition. For example, even when the reserve is ZERO, the condition will pass. 

```javascript
       if (reservedUsd > maxReservedUsd) {
            revert InsufficientReserve(reservedUsd, maxReservedUsd);
        }
```
3) As a result, the minimum reserve cannnot be ensured.  

## Impact
``validateReserve()`` fails to validate and ensure the minimum reserve, as a result, a bank run cannot be prevented.

## Recommendation
The revision is as follows. 

```diff
function validateReserve(
        DataStore dataStore,
        Market.Props memory market,
        MarketPrices memory prices,
        bool isLong
    ) internal view {
        // poolUsd is used instead of pool amount as the indexToken may not match the longToken
        // additionally, the shortToken may not be a stablecoin
        uint256 poolUsd = getPoolUsdWithoutPnl(dataStore, market, prices, isLong);
        uint256 reserveFactor = getReserveFactor(dataStore, market.marketToken, isLong);
-       uint256 maxReservedUsd = Precision.applyFactor(poolUsd, reserveFactor);
+       uint256 minReservedUsd = Precision.applyFactor(poolUsd, reserveFactor);

        uint256 reservedUsd = getReservedUsd(
            dataStore,
            market,
            prices,
            isLong
        );

-        if (reservedUsd > maxReservedUsd) {
+       if (reservedUsd < minReservedUsd) {
            revert InsufficientReserve(reservedUsd, maxReservedUsd);
        }
    }
