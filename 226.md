# loss of precision while diving `block.timestamp` due to runding towards 0

## Summary

loss of precision while diving `block.timestamp` due to runding towards 0

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
uint256 timeKey = block.timestamp / divisor;
```
if divisor > 1e9 then this value is always 0, if divisor > 1e8 then this value is always 1

## Impact

such rounding can lead to loss of precision and incrementing same key slot again and again

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

add bounds for possible values of divisor or apply precision
