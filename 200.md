# difference in tx.gasPrice is not accounted while paying for execution

## Summary

for every execution, keeper gets paid `tx.gasPrice` * `estimatedGas` where `tx.gasPrice` can be different while creating action and executing action which can be gamed.

## Vulnerability Detail

let g1 = gasPrice when creating
let g2 = gasPrice when executing / cancelling

diff = (g2 - g1) * estimatedGas
if diff > 0 then keeper looses the difference and if diff < 0 then trader losses that difference by paying extra

## Impact

1) attacker can deplete WNT from vault by creating deposit and then cancelling that deposit at higher gas price since for cancel orders keeper is same as `msg.sender`

2) net loss to keeper when g2 > g1

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

adjust for gas price appropriately by 1) charging user at upper bound of gas price 2) adjusting for gas price while refunding user
