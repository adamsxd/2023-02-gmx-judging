# Incorrect ordering of parameters

## Summary

In the code snippet from `ExecuteDepositUtils.sol`, the parameters for calculating uint256 diff are swapped around.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Users will be unable to execute deposits, as smart contract will fail due to stack overflow error. This issue specifically occurs when the long token and short token are the same token which is specified as and handled as a valid case in the code. https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics/blob/91af13f93ee64e8cb50c37e4e8084037cbde15a7/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L375-L414

```solidity
if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount) {
    uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;

    if (diff < poolLongTokenAmount) {
        adjustedLongTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
        adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount - adjustedLongTokenAmount;
    } else {
        adjustedLongTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
    }
} else {
    uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;

    if (diff < poolShortTokenAmount) {
        adjustedShortTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
        adjustedLongTokenAmount - longTokenAmount - adjustedShortTokenAmount;
    } else {
        adjustedLongTokenAmount = 0;
        adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount)`, then `uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount`;
`if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount)`, then `uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount`;
