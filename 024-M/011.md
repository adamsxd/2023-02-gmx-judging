# Underflow in markets with the same long and short token

## Summary

GMX supports markets with the same long and short token. When executing deposits the market requires to transfer only long token and calculates the long and short amounts that would lead to the smallest amount of price impact by helping to balance the pool.

However, there exists an underflow bug in adjusting function that does not allow to deposit to the market which leads to denial of service.

## Vulnerability Detail

The expressions that lead to underflows are present in the following lines:
* If the expression (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L392) results with `true`, the statement (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L393) will underflow.
* Otherwise, if the expression (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L392) results with `false`, the statement (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L402) will underflow.

## Impact

The bug does not allow to deposit (leads to denial of service) to markets with the same long and short tokens.
