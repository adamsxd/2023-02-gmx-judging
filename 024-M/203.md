# Incorrect adjusted amount calculation in `getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts()` always reverts

## Summary
The cases are handled incorrectly, leading to the call always reverting, which means markets where the short and long token are the same will never work.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function calculates the adjusted token amounts that would minimize the price impact.
It first handles the case `poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount`.
The issue is that it performs the incorrect subtraction `poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount`, which will underflow.

```solidity
File: contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol
392: if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount) {
393:             uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;//@audit underflow

```

The same problem happens in the other block, which will always underflow (unless both amounts are 0, which is not a relevant case in a deposit context)

```solidity
File: contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol
401: } else {
402:             uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;
```

## Impact
`getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts()` always reverts.
This function is called internally in `executeDeposit` when `market.longToken == market.shortToken`.
This means deposits do not work in this case: markets where the long and short token are the same will simply not work.

## Recommendation
```diff
File: contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol
392: if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount) {
-393:             uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;
+393:            uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;
```

```diff
File: contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol
401: } else {
-402:             uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;
+402:             uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;
```
