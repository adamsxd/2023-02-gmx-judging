# getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts will always revert

## Summary
incorrect diff calculation will always cause getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts to revert. After this bug has been solved, another two bug will surface which will be submitted separately in two other reports.


## Vulnerability Detail
In `getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts`, notice `    if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount) {`. Right after it is the diff calculation. Notice how calculation will always revert since poolLongTokenAmount is always lesser than poolShortTokenAmount unless `poolLongTokenAmount == poolShortTokenAmount`. The else clause diff calculation will always revert.

```solidity
    if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount) {
            uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;


            if (diff < poolLongTokenAmount) {
                adjustedLongTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
                adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount - adjustedLongTokenAmount;
            } else {
                adjustedLongTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
            }
        } else {
            uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;


            if (diff < poolShortTokenAmount) {
                adjustedShortTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
                adjustedLongTokenAmount - longTokenAmount - adjustedShortTokenAmount;
            } else {
                adjustedLongTokenAmount = 0;
                adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
            }
        }


        return (adjustedLongTokenAmount, adjustedShortTokenAmount);

```

## Impact
In market that uses the same token for long token and short token, `executeDeposit` will always revert except for the rare occasion that poolLongTokenAmount == poolShortTokenAmount. 

## Linked issues 
1. loss of funds to user when depositing in a market that uses the same long token and short token
2. DOS to executeDeposit if diff is more than longTokenAmount

## Recommendation

Recommend correcting the diff calculation

```diff
    if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount) {
-           uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;
+           uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;


            if (diff < poolLongTokenAmount) {
                adjustedLongTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
                adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount - adjustedLongTokenAmount;
            } else {
                adjustedLongTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
            }
        } else {
-           uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;
+          uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;


            if (diff < poolShortTokenAmount) {
                adjustedShortTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
                adjustedLongTokenAmount - longTokenAmount - adjustedShortTokenAmount;
            } else {
                adjustedLongTokenAmount = 0;
                adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
            }
        }


        return (adjustedLongTokenAmount, adjustedShortTokenAmount);

```
