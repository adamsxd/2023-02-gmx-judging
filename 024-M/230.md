# unsatisfiable condition in `getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts`

## Summary

unsatisfiable condition in `getAdjustedLongAndShortTokenAmounts`

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        if (poolLongTokenAmount < poolShortTokenAmount) {
            uint256 diff = poolLongTokenAmount - poolShortTokenAmount;
```
always reverts

```solidity
        } else {
            uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;
```
always reverts

## Impact

any market which has same long and short token will never work
