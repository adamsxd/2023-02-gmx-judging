# Malicious order keepers can trigger the cancellation of any order, with old blocks

## Summary

Malicious order keepers can trigger the cancellation of any order by providing oracle prices from blocks unrelated to the order


## Vulnerability Detail

Each order [has](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/DecreaseOrderUtils.sol#L29-L36) [its](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/IncreaseOrderUtils.sol#L60-L66) [own](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/deposit/ExecuteDepositUtils.sol#L109-L113) [requirements](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/withdrawal/WithdrawalUtils.sol#L189-L193) [about](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/SwapOrderUtils.sol#L24-L29) what block ranges it expects. The error handler for each order only allows orders to be retried if the keeper provided empty/invalid prices. The error handlers make no such allowances for invalid blocks.

The order keepers are supposed to be a decentralized network, so it's likely that at some point there will be a bad actor, or one who uses the rules to their advantage, at the expense of other users.


## Impact

Orders will be canceled rather than retried by keepers that would have executed the order properly. This may lead to position liquidations.


## Code Snippet

These are three revert errors that are not caught by the [various](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/OrderHandler.sol#L227) [error](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/WithdrawalHandler.sol#L187) [handlers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/exchange/DepositHandler.sol#L190):

    function revertOracleBlockNumbersAreSmallerThanRequired(uint256[] memory oracleBlockNumbers, uint256 expectedBlockNumber) internal pure {

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Add checks for these errors, and make the functions result in a revert rather than a cancellation
