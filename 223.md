# we can make this swap fail until we get a minOutput price that is good and make crazy profit by making it a big value

## Summary

we can make this swap fail until we get a minOutput price that is good and make a crazy profit
by making it a big value

## Vulnerability Detail
if we specify a huge `minOutput` the tx won't get executed and we can do this to many orders and gain free profit by waiting until the tx is in our favor.
## Impact
free profit or not being able to get liquidate or swap
just like the other issue, I reported the same effect but a different check that is wrong and can cause issues
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        if (outputAmount < params.minOutputAmount) {
            revert InsufficientSwapOutputAmount(outputAmount, params.minOutputAmount);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
cancel the orders that are not getting executed by the keepers for whatever reason
