# No Slippage protection in `swap` allows MEV Attack and Loss of Funds while executing Deposit

## Summary

In `ExecuteDepositUtils`, `swap` method is used in `executeDeposit` methods which is vulnerable to MEV Attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `swap` method, the `SwapParams` passed contains `minOutputAmount` as Zero. There is no slippage control here which means that a malicious actor could, e.g., trivially insert transactions before and after the naive transaction (using the infamous "sandwich" attack), causing the smart contract to trade at a radically worse price, profit from this at the caller's expense, and then return the contracts to their original state, all at a low cost.

Here's how the attack can happen:

1. MEV Bot or any attacker Detect this `swap` transaction in mempool.
2. It Front-Run the victimâ€™s transaction. Can possibly use Flash Loans for it to maximise the damage.
3. As the Pool balance is manipulated, Victim transacts with this pool and suffers higher slippage.
4. The attacker then back-runs the victim, and maximize it's profit from the loss of victim which is this migration is our case.

## Impact

Loss of Funds.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: ExecuteDepositUtils.sol

  (address outputToken, uint256 outputAmount) = SwapUtils.swap(
      SwapUtils.SwapParams(
          params.dataStore, // dataStore
          params.eventEmitter, // eventEmitter
          params.oracle, // oracle
          params.depositVault, // bank
          initialToken, // tokenIn
          inputAmount, // amountIn
          swapPathMarkets, // swapPathMarkets
          0, // minOutputAmount
          market, // receiver
          false // shouldUnwrapNativeToken
      )
  );

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a valid value for slippage or add a parameter `expectedOutputAmount` and check that should be equal to `outputToken`.
