# Incorrect function call leads to stale borrowing fees

## Summary
Due to an incorrect function call while getting the total borrow fees, the returned fees will be an inaccurate and stale amount. Which will have an impact on liquidity providers


## Vulnerability Detail

As said the function  `getTotalBorrowingFees`:

    function getTotalBorrowingFees(DataStore dataStore, address market, address longToken, address shortToken, bool isLong) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 openInterest = getOpenInterest(dataStore, market, longToken, shortToken, isLong);
        uint256 cumulativeBorrowingFactor = getCumulativeBorrowingFactor(dataStore, market, isLong);
        uint256 totalBorrowing = getTotalBorrowing(dataStore, market, isLong);
        return openInterest * cumulativeBorrowingFactor - totalBorrowing;
    }

calculates the fess by calling  `getCumulativeBorrowingFactor(...)`:

which is the wrong function to call because it returns a stale borrowing factor. To get the actual borrowing factor and calculate correctly the borrowing fees, GMX should call the `getNextCumulativeBorrowingFactor` function:


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L1826


Which makes the right calculation, taking into account the stale fees also:

        uint256 durationInSeconds = getSecondsSinceCumulativeBorrowingFactorUpdated(dataStore, market.marketToken, isLong);
        uint256 borrowingFactorPerSecond = getBorrowingFactorPerSecond(
            dataStore,
            market,
            prices,
            isLong
        );

        uint256 cumulativeBorrowingFactor = getCumulativeBorrowingFactor(dataStore, market.marketToken, isLong);

        uint256 delta = durationInSeconds * borrowingFactorPerSecond;
        uint256 nextCumulativeBorrowingFactor = cumulativeBorrowingFactor + delta;
        return (nextCumulativeBorrowingFactor, delta);

## Impact
Ass fee calculation will not be accurate, liquidity providers will be have a less-worth token  because pending fees are not accounted in the pool's value

## Recommendation

In order to mitigate the issue, call the function `getNextCumulativeBorrowingFactor` instead of the function `getCumulativeBorrowingFactor()` for a correct accounting and not getting stale fees
