# same signature can be used multiple times for validation in oracle while setting prices

## Summary

same signature can be used multiple times for validation in oracle while setting prices

## Vulnerability Detail

when keepers submit prices, they submit signature which to preserve integrity and establishing prices are actually transmitted by keeper. while setting prices in oracle, each signature and data is recovered to signer and check against expected signer.

keeper can steal other keeper's  data + signature from previously executed round and use it in next round and it will be accepted. the only uniqueness in data is `blockhash` which can be 0 if difference is more than 256 blocks.

## Impact

keeper can collect various such signatures with zero blockhash which can result is skewed min / max / median and mean prices and trades would be settle against that.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

use `block.number` as uniqueness or mark signature as used (for e.g mapping from bytes32 to bool) and check against it
