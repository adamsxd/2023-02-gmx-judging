# No way to reimburse funding fees from an insurance fund

## Summary

In cases where a liquidation results in there not being enough collateral to cover the funding fee, the code comments say that the pool will be topped up via an insurance fund.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no way to reimburse funding fees from an insurance fund, because the pool value is not based on the balance of tokens, but on separate tracking of specific token amounts. Tokens manually sent without calling [applyDeltaToPoolAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L666), will have no effect on the pool balance. 

## Impact

When such a shortfall occurs, the pool is not paused in any way, so users that sell their market tokens will do so without being paid what they're owed, an users that buy the tokens will purchase them at a discount until the pool is upgraded, and the fees are properly distributed.

## Code Snippet
There is no code that accomplishes the action described by the comment:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.sol : DecreasePositionCollateralUtils.getLiquidationValues()   #1

333            if (fees.funding.fundingFeeAmount > params.position.collateralAmount()) {
334                values.pnlAmountForPool = 0;
335 @>             // the case where this is insufficient collateral to pay funding fees
336                // should be rare, and the difference should be small
337                // in case it happens, the pool should be topped up with the required amount using
338                // an insurance fund or similar mechanism
339                PositionEventUtils.emitInsufficientFundingFeePayment(
340                    params.contracts.eventEmitter,
341                    params.market.marketToken,
342                    params.position.collateralToken(),
343                    fees.funding.fundingFeeAmount,
344:                   params.position.collateralAmount()
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Add a function to sweep latent pool tokens into the pool balance, only callable by a keeper
