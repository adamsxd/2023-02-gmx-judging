# If a user makes a tx from their wallet they can get frontrunned and lose their funds



## Summary

If a user makes a tx from their wallet they can get frontrunned and lose their funds

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user requests, they have to give funds first and then the user calls  `createDeposit` function (just using a deposit as an ex:) which shows the difference in the balance of the  `bank` and records the change. An attacker can front-run the users' request, make their own request, and take the funds.
ex:
bob sends  1 weth to the deposit vault (1 tx)
bob  makes a request (2tx)
Alice after the 1 tx front runs the (2 tx) and steals the funds

## Impact

an attacker can front-run and make requests with stolen funds

## Code Snippet

```solidity

        uint256 initialLongTokenAmount = depositVault.recordTransferIn(params.initialLongToken);
        uint256 initialShortTokenAmount = depositVault.recordTransferIn(params.initialShortToken);


```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

have sending funds and creating orders and deposits  into 1 tx but this issue is only for smart contract users (probably ui will solve this issue)
