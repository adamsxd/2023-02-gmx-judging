# Slippage is not respected if PnL swap associated with a decrease order fails

## Summary

After a position has been decreased, the user has an option to convert the PnL token to any other token via a swap.


## Vulnerability Detail

If the swap fails (which is where the slippage is checked), the tokens are sent directly to the user, without checking whether there was slippage


## Impact

A user will get back fewer tokens than they expect, if there was a large price impact, and the subsequent swap fails due to e.g. the market being temporarily disabled, or the swap impact being too large, or a token being swapped through is paused


## Code Snippet

Funds are sent back directly, without checking for slippage:
```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/DecreaseOrderUtils.sol : DecreaseOrderUtils._handleSwapError()   #1

168            emit SwapUtils.SwapReverted(reason, reasonBytes);
169    
170            MarketToken(payable(order.market())).transferOut(
171                result.outputToken,
172                order.receiver(),
173 @>             result.outputAmount,
174                order.shouldUnwrapNativeToken()
175            );
176:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Calculate whether the USD value of `outputToken` is equivalent to the `minOutputAmount` expected by the order, and revert if it's less than required
