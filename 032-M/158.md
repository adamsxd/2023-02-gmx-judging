# Global position-fee-related state not updated until _after_ liquidation checks are done

## Summary

Global position-fee-related state not updated until _after_ liquidation checks are done


## Vulnerability Detail

Checking whether a position is liquidatable occurs before the global state is updated.


## Impact

A position that should be liquidated in the current block, won't be liquidated until the next block, when the correct fee multipliers/factors are applied. A delayed liquidation means that a position that should have been liquidated will not be, likely causing a larger loss than should have been incurred.


## Code Snippet

State is updated _after_ the liquidation checks:

```solidity
// File: gmx-synthetics/contracts/position/DecreasePositionUtils.sol : DecreasePositionUtils.decreasePosition()   #1

162 @>         if (BaseOrderUtils.isLiquidationOrder(params.order.orderType()) && !PositionUtils.isPositionLiquidatable(
163                params.contracts.dataStore,
164                params.contracts.referralStorage,
165                params.position,
166                params.market,
167                cache.prices,
168                true
169            )) {
170                revert PositionShouldNotBeLiquidated();
171            }
172    
173:@>         PositionUtils.updateFundingAndBorrowingState(params, cache.prices);

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Call `PositionUtils.updateFundingAndBorrowingState()` before all checks
