# Incorrect calculation of the value in the pool

## Summary
On the way to calculate the entire pool value, GMX is including the fees that the user that borrows funds has to pay to the address in `feeReceiver` in the pool value 

## Vulnerability Detail
The specific line where this happens is: 

          cache.value += Precision.applyFactor(cache.totalBorrowingFees, cache.borrowingFeeReceiverFactor);

As you can see, they add the borrowing fees to the cache.value (pool value basically). To specify, those borrowing fees are distributed between the `feeReceiver` and the pool, therefore here shows better that the fees that will go to `feeReceiver`, shouldn't be accounted inside pool value.

## Impact
Incorrectly handles the real balance from the pool because those funds do not really belong to the pool. 
Therefore it affects the accounting while depositing and withdrawing:

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make a distinction  between the borrowing fees that go to the pool and the ones that go to `feeReceiver`, therefore only accounting the fees that will go to the pool as pool value
