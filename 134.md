# Single-sided deposits that are auto-adjusted do not account for token exchange rates

## Summary

Deposits of only the long collateral token, when doing so results in an auto-adjustment of the order to minimize price impact, results in a re-balancing of amounts that does not take into account the fact that the long and short collateral tokens have different values.


## Vulnerability Detail

The long pool token amount is not converted to a USD value before it's split into long and short portions, via simple division of the difference.

## Impact

If one wei of the short collateral token is more valuable than one wei of the long collateral token (e.g. L:WETH/S:WBTC) and the least price impact requires converting a portion of the long token to the short token, the small portion of WETH converted to the same amount of wei of WBTC will be much more valuable, and this extra value will be at the expense of the other depositors and their principal. If the short collateral token is less valuable than the long collateral token (e.g. L:WETH/S:USDC), then the transaction will likely revert, since the user-provided minimum market tokens out check won't be satisfied.


## Code Snippet

Adjustment is based on the difference between the pool token amounts, irrespective of each token's wei value:

394    
395                if (diff < poolLongTokenAmount) {

398                } else {
399                    adjustedLongTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
400                }
401            } else {
402                uint256 diff = poolShortTokenAmount - poolLongTokenAmount;
403    
404                if (diff < poolShortTokenAmount) {
405 @>                 adjustedShortTokenAmount = diff + (longTokenAmount - diff) / 2;
406 @>                 adjustedLongTokenAmount - longTokenAmount - adjustedShortTokenAmount;
407                } else {
408                    adjustedLongTokenAmount = 0;
409                    adjustedShortTokenAmount = longTokenAmount;
410                }
411:           }

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Convert to USD value before doing the adjustment, then convert back to token amounts after the adjustment
