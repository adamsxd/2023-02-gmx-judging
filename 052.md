# `GasUtils.payExecutionFee` is subject to re-entrency. Keeper can be a smart contract that bundle oracle update & additional userOperation.

## Summary
`GasUtils.payExecutionFee` is subject to re-entrency. Keeper can be a smart contract that bundle oracle update & userOperation into a single transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
`GasUtils.payExecutionFee` is used in both end of Deposit and Withdraw to pay keeper for the execution cost. This function calls `bank.transferOutNativeToken` which relies `TokenUtils.withdrawAndSendNativeToken` which finally use the native function `payable(receiver).call`; Since the receiver is only checked to be an non-null address, it can be a smart contract, that bundles arbitrary actions. 

For example upon completing a deposit action, the call can then be bundled into an oracle update that increases the price of the deposit token, then call a withdrawal immediately.

According to the descriptions, `Order keepers: checks for deposit / withdraw liquidity requests, order requests, bundles the signed oracle prices with the requests and executes them`, In this case the keeper can enforce same tx ordering using the callback function from gasExecutionFee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use transfer instead of call to limit the gasLimit during the transfer of nativeToken. If "revert" upon failure is unwanted, then consider add an explicit gasLimit for the existing `call` to mitigate bundled tx.
