# Unable to execute order to tokens with only Chainlink prices

## Summary

In order to execute an order, `setExactOrderPrice()` function in `BaseOrderUtils.sol` needs to be called.
However, for tokens without the necessary prices will error in this function call and hence make the order not be able to execute.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function `setExactOrderPrice()` requires a secondary price for order types `LimitIncrease`, `LimitDecrease` and `StopLossDecrease`.
However secondary prices only get set for tokens in `_setPrices()` and not in `_setPricesFromPriceFeeds()` [from Chainlink].
Only primary prices are set in `_setPricesFromPriceFeeds()`.

Given the fact that two internal functions to set prices `_setPrices()` and `_setPricesFromPriceFeeds()` iterate over different lists of tokens, it is possible for a token to not have a secondary price set for it.

Hence all orders for all tokens are in `params.tokens` (list used in `_setPrices()`) but not in `priceFeedTokens` (list used in `_setPricesFromPriceFeeds()`) will fail that are either `LimitIncrease`, `LimitDecrease` or `StopLossDecrease`.

## Impact

The impact is that a user order for a stop loss may not be able to execute because of this error, hence causing the user to potentially lose unforeseen amount of liquidity should the price keep moving against them during the period when the order is not able to execute.

```solidity
if (orderType == Order.OrderType.LimitIncrease ||
      orderType == Order.OrderType.LimitDecrease ||
      orderType == Order.OrderType.StopLossDecrease
  ) {
      uint256 primaryPrice = oracle.getPrimaryPrice(indexToken).pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice);
      uint256 secondaryPrice = oracle.getSecondaryPrice(indexToken).pickPrice(shouldUseMaxPrice);
}
```
            
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set secondary prices in `_setPricesFromPriceFeeds()` too, or ensure that all tokens for which orders are submitted for has a secondary price
