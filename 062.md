# adversary can frontrun user createDeposit to steal their tokens

## Summary
Before user can create a deposit, they will have to send in the prerequisite tokens to withdrawVault. However, an adversary can frontrun `createDeposit` of user and claim the sent in tokens by user.

## Vulnerability Detail

When creating deposit, `recordTransferIn` will be called to record the amount user have transferred to depositVault before calling `createDeposit`. If an adversary frontruns user `createDeposit`, they can claim the tokens transferred and cancel deposit to gain the tokens.

```solidity
        uint256 initialLongTokenAmount = depositVault.recordTransferIn(params.initialLongToken);
        uint256 initialShortTokenAmount = depositVault.recordTransferIn(params.initialShortToken);
```

Same for creating withdrawal,

```solidity
        uint256 wntAmount = withdrawalVault.recordTransferIn(wnt);
```

And creating order,

```solidity
            initialCollateralDeltaAmount = orderVault.recordTransferIn(params.addresses.initialCollateralToken);
```

Withdraw vault and deposit vault and order vault use the same logic for recordTransferIn 

```solidity
    function _recordTransferIn(address token) internal returns (uint256) {
        uint256 prevBalance = tokenBalances[token];
        uint256 nextBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        tokenBalances[token] = nextBalance;

        return nextBalance - prevBalance;
    }

```

Note: this applies to `updateOrder` and any other functions that uses `recordTransferIn`.

## Impact
Adversary can frontrun users to steal their tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend doing the transfer of tokens in `recordTransferIn` to prevent frontrunning attacks.
