# Keeper gas drained

## Summary

Creating a `LimitSwap` order that is impossible to fill will drain the gas in the keeper.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a `LimitSwap` is placed with very high `minOutputAmount` (i.e. impossible to fill), then it will get frozen which sets `executionFee` to 0 and pays gas to the keeper that froze the order. 
Then, a `frozenOrderKeeper` will come round and try execute the order, which will fail again and the freeze code will be executed again in the catch block, but the following check will result in a revert and failed transaction which swallows gas from the keeper:

```solidity
if (order.isFrozen()) {
    revert OrderAlreadyFrozen();
}
```

## Impact

If the gas in frozenOrderKeeper is drained, then no frozen orders will be able to execute and users with LimitDecrease or StopLossDecrease orders will not have their orders executed and could result in loss of funds due to exposure to price which could have been avoided, had the orders been able to execute.

## Code Snippet

LoC: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/order/OrderUtils.sol#L259-L296

```solidity
function freezeOrder(
    DataStore dataStore,
    EventEmitter eventEmitter,
    OrderVault orderVault,
    bytes32 key,
    address keeper,
    uint256 startingGas,
    string memory reason,
    bytes memory reasonBytes
) external {
    Order.Props memory order = OrderStoreUtils.get(dataStore, key);
    BaseOrderUtils.validateNonEmptyOrder(order);

    if (order.isFrozen()) {
        revert OrderAlreadyFrozen();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommendation is to remove the order from the waiting list if it is frozen and errors out again
