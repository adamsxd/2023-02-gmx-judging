# Admin can revoke role for everyone including the contract and make it unusable

## Summary
Admin can revoke roles for everyone including the contract and make it unusable due to insufficient checks in the `_revokeRole()` function

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `_revokeRole()` is responsible for revoking roles from accounts, but it is  designed to ensure that there is always at least one `ROLE_ADMIN` and one `TIMELOCK_MULTISIG` account, perhaps to ensure that the contract roles are never revoked or there is at least one account capable of performing admin activities, this can be seen in the code below

```solidity
function _revokeRole(address account, bytes32 roleKey) internal {
        roleMembers[roleKey].remove(account);
        roleCache[account][roleKey] = false;

        if (roleMembers[roleKey].length() == 0) {
            if (roleKey == Role.ROLE_ADMIN) {
                revert ThereMustBeAtLeastOneRoleAdmin();
            }
            if (roleKey == Role.TIMELOCK_MULTISIG) {
                revert ThereMustBeAtLeastOneTimelockMultiSig();
            }
        }
    }

```

But these checks are not sufficient, because a TimeLockAdmin can add an account (even an invalid one, which he has no control of its private key) and grant the role of `ROLE_ADMIN` and `TIMELOCK_MULTISIG`, this will make sure that the check `roleMembers[roleKey].length() == 0` is always false, the `TimeLockAdmin` can then proceed to revoke the role of all accounts including the contract itself and possibly even his account without ever triggering the checks. This then allows for many possibilities like the contract becoming unusable (DOS) or the `TimeLockAdmin` getting complete control of the contract

## Impact
The vulnerability will allow for a complete loss of all user funds because the contract can be made unusable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
More checks should be implemented to make sure the contract roles cannot be revoked, and perhaps even the kind of accounts that are being granted roles
