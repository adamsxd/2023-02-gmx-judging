# sendWnt() fails to check whether msg.value == amount and a user might gain/loss native tokens.

## Summary
``sendWnt()`` allows a user to send ``amount`` of wrapped native tokens to a receiver. However, it does not check whether ``msg.value == amount``, that is, there is no guarantee that the sender will send the specified amount of native tokens to the ``ExchangeRouter`` contract, which resulted in two impacts:

1) If there are already native tokens in ``ExchangeRouter``, a user can steal all those native tokens to his personal wallet address. 

2) If there are no native tokens in ``ExchangeRouter``, and a user sent more native tokens than ``amount``, then the remaining native tokens will be lost from the user. The transaction will only send ``amount`` of wrapped tokens to the receiver. 




## Vulnerability Detail

The ``sendWnt()`` function allows a user to wrap the specified amount of native tokens into WNT then sends the WNT to the specified address.

It calls the ``TokenUtils.depositAndSendWrappedNativeToken()`` to achieve that. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/token/TokenUtils.sol#L88-L105](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/token/TokenUtils.sol#L88-L105)

However, these two functions do not check whether ``msg.value == amount``. 
As a result, a malicious user Bob can steal native tokens from the ``ExchangeRouter`` contract if there are any there by calling 
```javascsript
       sendWnt(Bob, ExchangeRouter's native token balance)
```

On the other hand, if Alice likes to send 1000 WNT to kathy, and she calls  
```javascript
sendWnt(Kathy, 1000)
```
but sending 10000 native tokens for the transaction. The transaction will fail to detect that Alice sent too much native tokens to the contract. The transaction will send 1000 WNT to Kathy and kept the 9000 native tokens in the contract, subject to the attacker Bob described above. 



## Impact
A malicious user can steal WNT from ``ExchangeRouter`` while some other users might loss native tokens to ``ExchangeRouter`` .

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We need to check whether ``msg.value == amount``:
```diff
function sendWnt(address receiver, uint256 amount) external payable nonReentrant {
+      if(msg.value != amount) WntAmountNotMatching();
        ReceiverUtils.validateReceiver(receiver);
        TokenUtils.depositAndSendWrappedNativeToken(dataStore, receiver, amount);
    }
```
