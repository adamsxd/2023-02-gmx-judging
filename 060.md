# Keepers can manipulate with prices

## Summary
Because it's enough to provide `Keys.MIN_ORACLE_SIGNERS` amount of signatures out of all valid signers it's possible for keeper to manipulate with prices.
## Vulnerability Detail
When keeper executes order, he provides prices for the tokens, that are provided and signed by valid signers.
It's needed to provide at least [minimum amount of signatures](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/oracle/Oracle.sol#L225-L227) to make tx valid.

But there can be more than `Keys.MIN_ORACLE_SIGNERS` amount of valid signers, that can sign prices.
For example, if there are 10 valid signers and `Keys.MIN_ORACLE_SIGNERS` is 5, that means that keeper can manipulate by prices and provide only that 5 of 10 signatures that can make median price bigger/less and have impact on order's execution.
## Impact
Keepers are able to manipulate with token's price.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure, that `Keys.MIN_ORACLE_SIGNERS` is not much less than all valid signers count.
