# executing orders might get broken due to console.log

## Summary

executing orders might get broken due to console.log

## Vulnerability Detail

`console` lib of hardhat calls a specific address [`0x000000000000000000636F6e736F6c652e6c6f67`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/main/packages/hardhat-core/console.sol#L5)  which if has non-zero code then can consume all gas and cause out of gas revert.

this is likely dev enviornment leftover, any untrusted address should not be called in production

## Impact

It can lead to contracts being unusable for that specific path of execution (which is "executing orders" in this case) leading to denial-of-service if that un-trusted address has non-zero bytecode

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

remove `console.log` and replace with emitting event if required.
