# ExchangeRouter.sendTokens function is payable but native token sent to it will be lost

## Summary
The `ExchangeRouter.sendTokens` function sends tokens to another address.
Native tokens can be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function is payable so native tokens should be handled as well.
However they will not be transferred and are lost.
In fact anybody can withdraw them using the `ExchangeRouter.sendWnt` function.

## Impact
Native token sent to the function with the assumption that they are also sent will be lost.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `payable` modifier from the function or if `msg.value != 0` send the native token to the `receiver` as well.
