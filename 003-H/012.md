# Unclaimable collateral

## Summary

After decreasing the position, the protocol increases claimable collateral. Later, user is meant to clam this collateral within a separate transaction calling `ExchangeRouter.claimCollateral` function. However, the function always reverts and does not allow to claim.  

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claimCollateral` function in `MarketUtils` library compares the claimable amount and already claimed amount (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L632). However, the function reverts if the claimable amount is greater than already claimed amount which is true by default (any claimable amount is greater than 0). The expression is never false and thus, does not allow to claim collateral.

## Impact

The user who has decreased position is not allowed to claim collateral.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change expression in `if` statement to:
`if (adjustedClaimableAmount <= claimedAmount) {`
