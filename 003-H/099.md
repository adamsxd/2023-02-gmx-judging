# Wrong if statement logic breaks the claimable process

## Summary

On the following 2 lines:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx/blob/main/gmx-synthetics/contracts/market/MarketUtils.sol#L632-L633

there is a signing mistake that makes the collateral unclaimable to users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem with those 2 lines that try to check that no more collateral is claimed than the available to claim is that, as you can see,

        if (adjustedClaimableAmount >= claimedAmount) {
            revert CollateralAlreadyClaimed(adjustedClaimableAmount, claimedAmount);
        } 


the following uses wrong signing: adjustedClaimableAmount >= claimedAmount

With this logic the execution will revert always that the claimable amount is higher or equal than the claimed amount, which does not male sense.

Imagine the case where:

You have to claim 200 USDC
You claimed 0 USDC

200 >= 0    <--- TRUE

As you can see, the sign is incorrectly used, leading to users not being able to claim their collateral
## Impact
Critical, users will not be able to claim their collateral

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The is statement has to change signing:

              if(adjustedClaimableAmount <= claimedAmount) revert  CollateralAlreadyClaimed();
